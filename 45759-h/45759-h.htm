<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXXV" id="CHAPTER_XXXV">CHAPTER XXXV.</a></h2>


<div class="sidenote">George I
proclaimed
king, 1 Aug.,
1714.</div>

<p>Like her predecessor on the throne, Queen Anne
died on a Sunday. A proclamation was immediately
drawn up by the lords spiritual and temporal, assisted
by the members of the Privy Council and the lord
mayor, aldermen and citizens of London, announcing
the accession of Prince George, the Elector of
Hanover, and that same afternoon he was duly
proclaimed at Temple Bar and elsewhere. The
proclamation does not appear on this occasion to
have borne the signature of the lord mayor or any of
the aldermen.<a name="FNanchor_1" id="FNanchor_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">City addresses
to the new
king.</div>

<p>Some weeks elapsed before George arrived in
England. Meanwhile the Common Council prepared
an address which the lords justices, who held the reins
of government until the king's arrival, transmitted to
his majesty. The address was graciously received,
and the king, who knew little or no English, sent
word by the lords justices that the City might count
upon his support. Both the Common Council and
the Court of Aldermen were desirous of presenting
addresses to the king in person soon after his arrival.<a name="FNanchor_2" id="FNanchor_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">The reception
of George I
by the City,
20 Sept., 1714.</div>

<p>The 20th September being the day fixed for the
king's passage through the city to St. James's Palace
great preparations were made to give him a befitting
reception. It was decided to adopt the same measures
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>as those taken for the reception of William III in 1697,
after the conclusion of the Peace of Ryswick but with
this exception, viz., that members of the Common
Council should take the place in the procession of
those who had either served or fined for sheriff.<a name="FNanchor_3" id="FNanchor_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>
The earl marshal, however, ruled that the common
councilmen of London should neither ride nor march
in the procession. The court thereupon appealed to
the lords justices, but the result is not recorded.<a name="FNanchor_4" id="FNanchor_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> On
the day appointed the mayor and aldermen took up
their station at the court-house on St. Margaret's Hill
in Southwark. Cushions from the Bridge House were
borrowed for the occasion, and the open space before
the court-house was fenced with rail to prevent
crowding.<a name="FNanchor_5" id="FNanchor_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> His lordship was provided with a new
crimson velvet gown, the city marshal's men with
new liveries, and the city trumpeters with new
cloaks.<a name="FNanchor_6" id="FNanchor_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> The conduits ran with claret furnished by
order of the Court of Aldermen. The erection of
balcony stands was discouraged for fear of accidents,
and for the same reason the firing of guns or <i>padreros</i>
under the piazza of the Royal Exchange was forbidden.<a name="FNanchor_7" id="FNanchor_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a>
At St. Margaret's Hill the king was welcomed by the
Recorder, who read a congratulatory address on behalf
of the citizens, after which the procession moved on
towards the city, the Recorder taking up his position
immediately in front of the mayor,<a name="FNanchor_8" id="FNanchor_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> who rode bareheaded
with the city sword in his hand.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span></p>
<div class="sidenote">Precautions
against the
Pretender.</div>

<p>Three days later (23 Sept.) the whole of the
Common Council proceeded to St. James' to present
their congratulations to the king on his safe arrival,
and to assure him of their loyalty.<a name="FNanchor_9" id="FNanchor_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> This assurance
was opportune, for the country was being flooded
with pamphlets advocating the claim of Prince James
Edward, better known as the Pretender, to the
throne, and a reward had been offered for the capture
of the prince should he attempt to set foot in any
of his majesty's dominions.<a name="FNanchor_10" id="FNanchor_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> When Humphreys
entered on his mayoralty in the following October he
made himself especially active in putting a stop to
the spread of seditious literature in the city, and for
his services in this respect was heartily thanked by
Secretary Townsend.<a name="FNanchor_11" id="FNanchor_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">The king
attends the
lord mayor's
banquet,
29 Oct., 1714.</div>

<p>On the 20th October the king was crowned,<a name="FNanchor_12" id="FNanchor_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a>
and on the 29th, according to custom, he attended
the lord mayor's banquet. The lord mayor was
called upon to contribute the sum of &pound;300, and each
of the sheriffs the sum of &pound;150 towards defraying the
cost of the entertainment. The rest of the expenses
were paid out of the Chamber.<a name="FNanchor_13" id="FNanchor_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> So pleased was the
king with the entertainment that he conferred a
baronetcy upon the lord mayor. He also bestowed
the sum of &pound;1,000 for the relief of poor debtors.<a name="FNanchor_14" id="FNanchor_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Thanksgiving
service at
St. Paul's,
20 Jan., 1715.</div>

<p>By the end of the year all immediate danger
appeared to have passed away, and Thursday, the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>20th January, 1715, was appointed to be kept as

<div class="sidenote">General
Election,
1715.</div>

<p>In the meanwhile the statutory period of six
months&mdash;during which the parliament existing at the
time of the demise of the crown was to continue to
sit&mdash;had elapsed, and the last parliament of Queen
Anne had been dissolved (13 Jan.), a new one being
summoned to meet in March. Riots such as had
occurred at previous elections were strongly deprecated
by royal proclamation (11 Jan.), and a reward
of &pound;500 was offered for the discovery of the printer
or publisher of a paper intituled "English advice to
the freeholders of England," which had been freely
circulated for the purpose of advocating the Pretender's
claims.<a name="FNanchor_17" id="FNanchor_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> The elections, which were hotly
contested, resulted in the Whigs&mdash;the party already
in power&mdash;obtaining a large majority. The City
returned two aldermen, viz.: Sir John Ward, who
had sat in the parliament of 1708 in the Tory interest,
and Sir Thomas Scawen;<a name="FNanchor_18" id="FNanchor_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> and two commoners, viz.:
Robert Heysham and Peter Godfrey, of whom little
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>is known. As delegates of the City, they were to
carry out the City's instructions given to them under
twenty-one heads. They were more particularly to
cause an enquiry to be made as to the manner in
which the Peace of Utrecht had been brought about.<a name="FNanchor_19" id="FNanchor_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Impeachment

<p>Similar instructions were drawn up by electors in
other parts of the country, and so well were they
carried out that as soon as the Houses met preparations
were made to impeach Harley, Bolingbroke
and the Duke of Ormond, for the part they had
taken in the secret agreements made with the French
during the negotiations for peace. Bolingbroke and
Ormond immediately took fright and fled to France,
where the former entered the service of the Pretender
as secretary of state. Oxford, who alone stayed at
home and faced the storm, was forthwith committed
to the Tower.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Tory

<p>Such high-handed proceedings on the part of the

of all precautions<a name="FNanchor_20" id="FNanchor_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> riots broke out in the city on the
28th May, when the king's birthday was being kept
with bonfires and illuminations. The next day
(29 May), being the anniversary of the restoration
of Charles II, there were more bonfires, and those
who refused to light up their houses had their
windows broken. A patrol of life guards was insulted
and made to join in the cry "High Church and
Ormond!" A print of King William III was publicly
burnt in Smithfield, and the mob carried everything
before them until stopt in Cheapside by ward constables
and dispersed.<a name="FNanchor_21" id="FNanchor_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Jacobite
Conspiracy,
July, 1715.</div>

<p>The Jacobites took advantage of the general
disaffection that prevailed to push forward the conspiracy
which had been set on foot at the close of the
last reign. Ormond had up to the moment of his
flight been busily engaged in organising it in England,
while Bolingbroke had been no less busy in endeavouring
to obtain the assistance of France. On
the 20th July the king announced to the new parliament
that he had received information of a projected
invasion by the Pretender, which was abetted and
encouraged by disaffected persons in this country.<a name="FNanchor_22" id="FNanchor_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a>
Three days later (23 July) a similar announcement
was made to the lord mayor by letter from secretary
Townshend.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The City's
loyal address.</div>

<p>Notwithstanding the recent riots to which the
aggressive policy of the whigs had given rise, the
respectable citizen remained true Hanoverian and
staunch supporter of the established church. The
municipal body were proud of the part they had
taken in bringing about the "glorious" Revolution, and
in later years took occasion more than once to remind
George the Third that the House of Hanover owed
its accession to the crown of England in no small
measure to the citizens of London. As soon as the
secretary's letter was communicated to the Common
Council, they immediately drew up a loyal address,
in which they assured the king that they entertained
the utmost abhorrence and detestation of all who
encouraged either openly or secretly the hopes of
the Pretender, and promised their adherence to
his majesty's person and government against the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>

<div class="sidenote">Precautionary
measures.</div>

<p>An Act known in those days as the Proclamation
Act, but better known at the present day as the
Riot Act, investing magistrates with the power of
compelling any number of persons exceeding twelve
to disperse on pain of being held guilty of felony
without benefit of clergy was passed (20 July, 1715),<a name="FNanchor_24" id="FNanchor_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a>
whilst another Act authorising the appointment of
commissioners for tendering the oaths of allegiance
and supremacy, as well as the abjuration oath to
all suspected persons, was passed a month later
(20 Aug).<a name="FNanchor_25" id="FNanchor_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> Pursuant to this last Act, commissioners
were afterwards (5 Dec.) appointed for the purpose
of administering the oaths in each city ward.
The names of recusants were to be returned to the
next quarter sessions and there enrolled.<a name="FNanchor_26" id="FNanchor_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> Nor were
the municipal authorities idle. The anniversary of
the king's coronation (20 Oct.) was to have been
celebrated in the city by a solemn procession with
"effigies of several persons," and money had been
collected for the purpose of defraying expenses.
The mayor, however, hearing of this, issued a
precept to the effect that although the promoters
of the scheme might well have intended thereby to
show their affection to his majesty's person and
government "yet at this time, when the nation is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>alarmed by a rebellion, it is not thought convenient
to be permitted, lest under that pretence many
disaffected persons might gather together and raise
tumults to the endangering of the public peace."
The constables were accordingly instructed to prevent
any meeting for the purpose, and to prevent all
bonfires and illuminations.<a name="FNanchor_27" id="FNanchor_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">End of
Jacobite
rebellion,
Feb., 1716.</div>

<p>These precautionary measures were taken not
a whit too soon. The Earl of Mar, who had undertaken
the organization of an insurrection in Scotland
in favour of the Pretender, had already made himself
complete master of that country as far as the Forth.
He was, however, soon afterwards (13 Nov.) defeated
by the Earl of Argyle at Sheriffmuir near Stirling,
and although the Pretender himself appeared in
Scotland before the close of the year, not another
blow was struck, and in the following February
(1716) Prince James stole back to France, leaving
his army to shift for itself.</p>

<div class="sidenote">City address.
11 May, 1716.</div>

<p>The rebellion being thus put down, the Common
Council unanimously resolved (11 May, 1716) to
present another address to the king, in which after
offering their congratulations upon the failure of the
rebels to depose and murder his majesty, and to subvert
the Church and State, they declared their resolution
(1) as friends to monarchy to promote true zeal and
loyalty towards his majesty's person, (2) as members
of the Church of England to act up to its principles
by submitting to the powers that be, and (3) by all
possible means to prevent discord and support the
Protestant succession. To this the king returned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
a gracious answer, and expressed his conviction that
the example set by the City would have a good effect
upon the nation.<a name="FNanchor_28" id="FNanchor_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">The king's

<p>The Council at the same time resolved to set
up a statue of the king at the Royal Exchange
as well as his picture in the Guildhall. The royal
assent having been asked and obtained, Sir Godfrey
Kneller was sent for to paint the portrait. Considerable
delay took place in the execution of the
work,<a name="FNanchor_29" id="FNanchor_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> but the picture was at last completed and is
still believed to grace the walls of the members'

was reported to be so much decayed and torn as
to be incapable of repair.<a name="FNanchor_30" id="FNanchor_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> The statue, if ever set
up at the Royal Exchange, probably shared the fate
of other statues erected there, and was destroyed in
the fire of 1838.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Thanksgiving

<p>Thursday, the 7th June (1716), was ordered by
royal proclamation (8 May) to be kept as a day
of public thanksgiving for the suppression of the
rebellion. A sermon was preached at St. Paul's on
the occasion. The members of the livery companies
were desired to attend in their best gowns and hoods,
at nine o'clock in the morning; this early hour being
probably fixed so as not unduly to interfere with the

<div class="sidenote">The Septennial
Act,
April, 1716.</div>

<p>One of the immediate effects of the rebellion
was the repeal of the Triennial Act (passed Dec.,
1694), limiting the duration of parliament to three
years. According to the provisions of this Act a new
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>parliament would have to be elected in 1718. The
Whigs were afraid, however, to face the country and
risk the return of a Jacobite majority. The ministers
therefore proposed and parliament agreed that the
existing parliament should continue for a term of
seven instead of three years&mdash;a somewhat arbitrary
proceeding on their part and only to be justified by
the exigency of the time. The Septennial Act<a name="FNanchor_32" id="FNanchor_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a>
was only intended as a temporary measure, but it
has been found to work so well that it continues
to this day to regulate the duration of parliaments,
notwithstanding repeated efforts made by the City
in general and by Alderman Sawbridge in particular
to get it repealed.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The King and

<p>A few weeks later, parliament was prorogued
(26 June, 1716) and the king paid a visit&mdash;often
repeated during his reign&mdash;to his beloved Hanover,
leaving his son, the Prince of Wales, as guardian of
the realm and his lieutenant. Between father and
son there was never any love lost, there was a sort
of hereditary family quarrel, which in this case was
brought to a climax in November of the following
year over the christening of a babe. The court
became split up into two distinct parts. The prince
was ordered to quit St. James's and those who paid
court to the prince and princess were for ever banished
from the king's presence.<a name="FNanchor_33" id="FNanchor_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Trial of the
Earl of Oxford,
June,

<p>After remaining a prisoner in the Tower for
nearly two years, the Earl of Oxford was at length,
at his own request, brought to trial. The 13th June
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>(1717) was originally fixed as the day on which he was
to appear at Westminster Hall, but this was afterwards
changed to the 24th by desire of the House of
Commons, who wished to put off the trial as long as
possible. The lord mayor and sheriffs being directed
by the House of Lords to take precautions for guarding
the city's gates and preventing an unnecessary
concourse of people resorting to Westminster, it was
resolved to place double watch in the ward of
Farringdon Without during the trial "as was done in
the tryal of my Lord Winton and the like cases."<a name="FNanchor_34" id="FNanchor_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a>
Fortunately for the earl, a dispute arose between
the two houses on a question of procedure. The

out and declined to appear as his accusers, and the
Lords thereupon ordered his discharge.<a name="FNanchor_35" id="FNanchor_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Act for quieting

(5 Geo. i, c. 6)
1718.</div>

<p>For many years past the Corporation Act of 1661,
had not been strictly enforced in the city. Such
negligence laid the citizens open to pains and penalties.
It was therefore deemed advisable towards the end
of the next year (1718) to address the king on the
subject and a petition was drawn up by the Court of
Aldermen setting forth the apprehension of the
petitioners of being "disquieted in the execution of
their offices by pretence of not subscribing a declaration
against the Solemn League and Covenant at
the time of their admission into their respective
offices" according to the Statute. Such subscription
they submitted had been generally disused, and the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>Act in that particular, disregarded. Nevertheless,
the petitioners had behaved themselves in their
offices with all duty and affection to his majesty and
the government. They humbly prayed therefore that
His Majesty would take such order as should
effectually quiet their minds and enable them "to
proceed with cheerfulness in the execution of their
respective duties."<a name="FNanchor_36" id="FNanchor_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> This petition was received
very graciously by the king, who looked upon it as a
mark of the City's trust and confidence in him. "I
shall be glad"&mdash;he said&mdash;"not only for your sakes,
but my own, if any defects which may touch the
rights of my good subjects are discovered in my
time, since that will furnish me with means of
giving you and all my people an indisputable
proof of my tenderness for their privileges, and
how unwilling I shall ever be to take advantage
of their mistakes."<a name="FNanchor_37" id="FNanchor_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> His Majesty's assurance thus
given was quickly followed by the passing of an
Act for the purpose of relieving the City of London
and other boroughs of any disabilities for their
neglect in subscribing the prescribed declaration.<a name="FNanchor_38" id="FNanchor_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Disputed
election in
Tower Ward,
1717 1719.</div>

<p>The reign of George I was marked not only with
repeated disputes between the Court of Aldermen and
the Common Council, but also with disputes over
different municipal elections, until in 1725 matters
were to a certain extent accommodated by the passing
of the Election Act, 11 George I, c. 18. It had been
the custom of the City, whenever the ruling of an
alderman at a wardmote had been disputed, to defend
the alderman's action when brought before a court of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>law at the City's expense. The legality of this proceeding
was now questioned. In December, 1717,
when the annual elections for the Common Council
came on, there had been a disputed election in Tower
Ward, and the ruling of Alderman Sir Charles Peers
had been called in question by Peter Bolton and
Edward Bridgen, two unsuccessful candidates. The
dispute engaged the attention of the Common Council
and the law courts for a whole twelvemonth, the
expenses of the aldermen being defrayed by the City.
In February, 1719, it reached the House of Lords, but
before the matter came on for hearing a compromise
was effected, the City agreeing to pay taxed costs.</p>

<p>The reason for this sudden change of attitude
on the part of the City is doubtless to be found in a
resolution of the House of Lords (17 Feb., 1719)
to appoint a committee to examine and report what
sums of money the City had expended out of its
own chamber on this and similar causes, and what
jurisdiction the Common Council exercised over elections
of its members. The committee was authorized
to carry its investigations as far back as they deemed
proper, and to send for persons, papers and records.
On the 17th April the committee made its report to
the House. The Town Clerk and the City Chamberlain
had attended the committee with the necessary
warrants and minutes of proceedings, and it had been
found that a sum of &pound;2,827 10<i>s.</i> had been paid out of
the City's cash for carrying on causes and suits at law
relating to the elections of Aldermen and Common
Councilmen since the 8th November, 1711.<a name="FNanchor_39" id="FNanchor_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> As
regards the claim of the Common Council to hear<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
and determine matters in connection with elections
of its own members, the committee found that it
was based upon a resolution of the Court of the
9th January, 1641,<a name="FNanchor_40" id="FNanchor_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> which resolution had been disclaimed
(with many others) by Act of Common
Council of 1683.<a name="FNanchor_41" id="FNanchor_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Resolution of
the House
thereon.</div>

<p>The report having been read, the House passed
a resolution to the effect that in maintaining suits at
law between citizen and citizen in cases of disputed
elections, the Common Council had "abused their
trust, and been guilty of great partiality, and of a
gross mismanagement of the city treasure, and a
violation of the freedom of elections in the city."</p>

<div class="sidenote">A protest
entered.</div>

<p>So scathing an indictment against the City was
not allowed to pass unchallenged. Sixteen peers
entered a vigorous protest on the several grounds:
(1) that no evidence had been taken on oath, and
that without such evidence they conceived that so
heavy a censure ought not to be passed on any individual,
much less on so important a body as the
Common Council of the city, which had done good
service on pressing occasions; (2) that the Common
Council had not had due notice given them; (3) that
the resolution of the House might be construed as
prejudging matters which might come before the
House judicially; and lastly (4) that had the Common
Council been heard they might have shown that the
money had been expended in defence of their ancient
rights and privileges, and in order to prevent any encroachment
thereon.<a name="FNanchor_42" id="FNanchor_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> That the dissentient Lords
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>had reason on their side there can be little doubt.
Nevertheless, some writers<a name="FNanchor_43" id="FNanchor_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> whilst setting out in full
the committee's report, as well as the returns made
by the Chamberlain of money expended by the City
on election suits, and the resolution of the House
thereon, have entirely ignored the fact that a solemn
protest was made against such resolution, and the
reasons which urged the dissentients to make such
protest.</p>

<div class="sidenote">What is
"paying
Scot?"</div>

<p>In the meantime another disputed election had
taken place. This time it concerned an alderman.
The mayor had reported the case to the Court of
Aldermen the day that the Lords appointed their
committee to investigate the City's law costs. The
case was shortly this. On the 9th January a wardmote
had been held at Cordwainers' Hall, for the
purpose of electing an alderman for the ward of Bread
Street, in the place of Sir Richard Hoare, deceased.
The show of hands for the respective candidates&mdash;Robert
Baylis and Richard Brocas, both of them
members of the Grocers' Company&mdash;had been so
equal that the mayor had been unable to declare
which had the majority. A poll had therefore been
demanded, the result being declared by the mayor to
be in favour of Brocas, and thereupon a scrutiny had
taken place, with the same result.<a name="FNanchor_44" id="FNanchor_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a> The whole
question turned upon the qualification of certain
voters. Did they or did they not pay Scot, and
in what did "paying Scot" consist? The matter
having been argued before the Court of Aldermen
by counsel on behalf of each candidate, the Court
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>came to the conclusion that paying Scot was "a
general contribution to <i>all</i> public taxes," and at
the same time declared Baylis to be duly elected.<a name="FNanchor_45" id="FNanchor_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a>
The Common Council then attempted to interfere,
but the Court of Aldermen would brook no invasion
of their rights,<a name="FNanchor_46" id="FNanchor_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a> and although litigation continued well
into the next year (1720) Baylis retained his seat in
the Court.</p>

<div class="sidenote">An insult
offered to an

Lord Mayor's
Day, 29 Oct.,
1720.</div>

<p>On Lord Mayor's day (29 Oct.) 1720, an incident
occurred worthy of a passing notice. From particulars
laid before the Court of Aldermen (10 Jan., 1721) by
a committee appointed to investigate the matter,<a name="FNanchor_47" id="FNanchor_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a> it
appears that when the members of the Court of
Aldermen were riding in their coaches towards the
Three Cranes on the banks of the river, thence to
attend the new lord mayor (Sir John Fryer) in his
barge to Westminster, a certain ensign in the Second
Regiment of the Guards&mdash;Thomas Hockenhull or
Hocknell by name&mdash;who was in charge of a detachment
of soldiers on their way to the Tower, thought
fit to break through the aldermen's procession, and to
bring Sir John Ward's coach to a sudden standstill,
his horses being struck over the head by the soldiers'
muskets. The affront was too serious to be passed
over, and Sir John reported the matter to Secretary
Craggs, who forwarded the alderman's letter to the
Secretary at War, and at the same time expressed
regret that such an incident should have happened.<a name="FNanchor_48" id="FNanchor_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a>
Later on the officer himself appeared before the Court
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>of Aldermen bearing a letter from Sir George Treby
to Alderman Ward to the effect that the officer had
already received a reprimand, and would (he hoped)
make a suitable apology. A written apology was
read to the Court of Aldermen in which Hockenhull
pleaded ignorance as to whose coach it was that had
been stopped, and endeavoured to throw the blame on
two of his soldiers, who he declared to be "a little in
liquor." The officer being called in offered to make
submission and to beg pardon, but the Court was not
in the humour to accept his apology, and so the matter
rested until the following January (1721), when upon
Sir George Treby's intercession and Hockenhull's
submission the Court agreed to pass the matter over.
The Secretary at War was at the same time desired
"that for the future the route for the Guards marching
to and from the Tower may be as usual through
Watling Street, and not through the high streets of
this city."</p>

<div class="sidenote">The South
Sea Company,
1711-1720.</div>

<p>Sir John Fryer had been elected mayor at one of
the most critical times in the history either of London
or the kingdom, for his election took place just at the
time of the bursting of the great South Sea bubble.
The South Sea Company had been formed in 1711 by
Harley, with the view of carrying on such trade with
Spanish America as Spain might be willing to allow in
the treaty which was then expected. When the Treaty
of Utrecht was concluded Spain was found to have
conceded the right of trading with America, but only
to a limited extent. Nevertheless the idea got
abroad that the company was possessed of a very
valuable monopoly, and that the trade with Spanish
America would enrich all who took part in it.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
Accordingly the shares of the company were eagerly
bought, and in a few years the institution began to
rival the Bank of England itself. Early in 1720,
when a scheme was propounded for lessening the
National Debt, the company was in a position to
outbid the Bank in buying up government annuities,
and holders of such annuities were found only too
ready to exchange them for shares in the company.
The company next invited the public to subscribe
new capital, and upwards of &pound;5,000,000 were subscribed
in an incredibly short space of time. The
wildest speculation prevailed. Bogus companies
sprang up in all directions, and no matter how
ridiculous the purpose might be for which they were
avowedly started, they always found subscribers.
Men of all ranks, ages, and professions, nay! women
also flocked to Threadneedle Street (where stood the
South Sea House) or to Change Alley, and the very
streets were blocked with desks and clerks, and
converted into counting-houses. The whole nation
suddenly became stock-jobbers. Swift, writing of the
ruin worked by the mad speculation of the day, thus
characterises Change Alley, the centre of all the
mischief:</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"There is a gulf where thousands fell<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Here all the bold adventurers came,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A narrow sound, though deep as hell;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">'<i>Change Alley</i> is the dreadful name."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The South Sea Company continued to maintain
its pre-eminent position, and the value of its
shares continued to rise until, in August, a &pound;100 share
was worth &pound;1,000.</p>

<p>At last it brought about its own ruin in a way
little anticipated. In an evil hour the directors<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
commenced proceedings against the unlicensed, and
therefore illegal, companies which had interfered with
the great company's more legitimate business. The
result was disastrous. One fraud after another was
exposed. The nation suddenly recovered its senses.
A panic arose as bubble after bubble burst. By the
end of September, South Sea stock had fallen from
&pound;1,000 to &pound;150, and at last, after an abortive effort
to obtain assistance from the Bank of England, this
biggest bubble of all collapsed, bringing thousands
to beggary. Even the Bank of England itself experienced
difficulty in maintaining its credit during
the panic, and was compelled once more to resort
to stratagem. Payments were made in silver, and
chiefly to persons who were in league with the bank,
and who no sooner received their money than they
brought it back. The money had of course to be
re-counted, and by this means time was gained, and
time at such a crisis, and to such an institution,
meant literally money. On Michaelmas-day the
Bank according to the custom prevailing was closed,
and when it opened again, the public alarm had
subsided.<a name="FNanchor_49" id="FNanchor_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Thomas Guy
and his
hospital.</div>

<p>A few&mdash;a very few&mdash;of those who had speculated
in South Sea stock kept their heads, and got out
before the bubble burst. Among these was Thomas
Guy, the founder of Guy's Hospital, at that time
carrying on business as a bookseller at the corner of
Lombard Street and Cornhill&mdash;the "lucky corner."
He made a large fortune by buying stock at a low
price and selling before the crash came, and right<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
good use did he make of his money, for at his death
he endowed the hospital called by his name with
a sum exceeding &pound;200,000.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Parliamentary
enquiry,
Jan., 1721.</div>

<p>As is not unusual in such cases, there was a
universal endeavour to fasten the guilt upon others
than the rash speculators themselves. An outcry
was raised, not only against the directors of the
company, but also against the ministry. Nothing
would suffice but a Parliamentary enquiry into the
affairs of the company. This was granted, and early
in the following year the Lords commenced an open
investigation, whilst the Commons appointed a committee
of secrecy. The Lords had scarcely entered
upon their investigation before it was discovered that
the secretary of the company had made his escape to
the continent. Thereupon the Commons gave orders
for all ports to be watched in order to prevent the
directors of the company following his example.
Any director holding office under Government was
dismissed. Two members of the House, who were
also directors, were expelled the House and taken
into custody. These were Jacob Sawbridge, the
grandfather of Alderman John Sawbridge, of whom
we shall hear more later on, and Sir Theodore
Janssen, the father of Stephen Theodore Janssen
who, after serving the City in Parliament and in the
Mayoralty chair, became the City's Chamberlain.
Other directors were also taken into custody and
their papers seized.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Sword-blade
Company.</div>

<p>Jacob Sawbridge was a member of the firm of
Turner, Caswall and Company, commonly known
as the Sword-blade Company, carrying on business
as goldsmiths in Birchin Lane. Sir George Caswall,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
one of the partners, was member for Leominster, and
was serving as Sheriff the year of the South Sea
Bubble. His firm had acted as cashiers of the South
Sea Company, and like many similar firms of goldsmiths,
had advanced large sums upon the company's
stock. The committee of secrecy appointed by the
House of Commons soon discovered that Sir George
had been guilty of tampering with the firm's books in
order to shield Charles Stanhope. For this he was
expelled the House and committed to the Tower,
whilst his firm was made to surrender its illgotten
gains to the extent of a quarter of a million sterling.<a name="FNanchor_50" id="FNanchor_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Parliament
and the
South Sea
Company.</div>

<p>All the directors were forced to send in inventories
of their respective estates to the Parliamentary
Committee. These were confiscated for the benefit
of their dupes, their owners being allowed some
small portion of their former wealth to keep them
from starvation. Peculation and dishonesty were not
confined to the city. Peers of the realm and cabinet
ministers were charged with receiving large bribes
either in money or stock. The Earl of Sunderland,
first commissioner of the Treasury, was reported by the
committee of investigation to have received &pound;50,000
stock without any consideration whatsoever, and
although the House of Commons refused to find
him guilty,<a name="FNanchor_51" id="FNanchor_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a> the Earl felt compelled to give up his
post. Craggs, who was Secretary of State, and
Aislabie, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, not to
mention others, were convicted by the House of
receiving similar bribes.<a name="FNanchor_52" id="FNanchor_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a> Craggs died of an attack
of small-pox, pending the enquiry, but he left a large
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>estate, and this was confiscated for the relief of
sufferers. Aislabie was expelled the House, and
committed to the Tower. Among the directors who
were thus made to feel the heavy hand of Parliament
was Edward Gibbon, grandfather of the great historian
of the "Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire."
Out of an estate of &pound;60,000, Parliament allowed him
to retain no more than &pound;10,000. That the action of
Parliament towards the directors was afterwards
condemned by the historian as arbitrary and unjust,
and only to be excused by the most imperious
necessity, need not therefore cause surprise.<a name="FNanchor_53" id="FNanchor_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">The action of
Parliament
upheld by the
City.</div>

<p>The city fathers, on the other hand, upheld the
action of Parliament, and urged it to take further
measures to alleviate the prevalent distress by presenting
to the House the following petition (3 April)<a name="FNanchor_54" id="FNanchor_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a>:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Your peticoners think it their duty most humbly
to represent to this Hono<sup>ble</sup> House the present state
of the City of London (so considerable a part of the
kingdom) now filled with numberless objects of
grief and compassion (the sad effects of the mismanagem<sup>t</sup>s
avarice and fatal contrivances of the late
Directors of the South Sea Company, their aiders,
abettors and confederates in the destrucc&otilde;n of their
country.)</p>

<p>"Nor is it the case of this great city alone your
peticoners lament, but the general decay of trade
manufactures and of public creditt, whereof this
Hono<sup>ble</sup> House have been alwaies so extreamly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>tender, as also of the honour of the British name
and nac&otilde;n.</p>

<p>"Your peticoners beg leave to return their most
humble thanks to this Hono<sup>ble</sup> House for the great
pains they have taken to releive the unhappy
sufferers by compelling the offenders to make restituc&otilde;n
as likewise for their continued applicac&otilde;n to
lay open this whole scene of guilt, notwithstanding
the industrious artificers of such sharers in the
common plunder as have endeavoured to obstruct
the detecc&otilde;n of fraud and corrupc&otilde;n, and your
peticoners doubt not but the same fortitude, impartiality
and public spirit wherewith this Hono<sup>ble</sup> House
have hitherto acted will still animate them in pursuit
of those truly great and noble ends.</p>

<p>"We are too sensible"&mdash;the petitioners went on
to say&mdash;"of the load of public debts not to wish that
all proper methods may be taken to lessen them,
and it is an infinite concern to us that the paiment
of a great summe towards them (which was expected
from the success of the late scheme) is now rendered
extreamly difficult, if not impracticable, and yet is a
cloud hanging over the heads of the present unfortunate
Proprietors of the South Sea Company, and
a great damp to public credit.</p>

<p>"We will not presume," they said in conclusion,
"to mention in what manner releif may be given in this
arduous affair, but humbly submit it to the serious
considerac&otilde;n of this Hono<sup>ble</sup> House."</p>

<p>This petition was followed by others in the same
strain from different parts of the country, and conduced
to the passing of a Bill which, besides appropriating<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
the sum of &pound;2,000,000 out of the private property of
the directors for the relief of sufferers, remitted a sum
of &pound;7,000,000 due by the Company to the Government,
and made an equitable division of the remainder
of the Company's capital among the proprietors.<a name="FNanchor_55" id="FNanchor_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Supremacy of
Walpole.</div>

<p>These measures were greatly, if not exclusively,
due to Walpole, the great financier of the day, and one
of the few who had not allowed themselves to become
involved in the affairs of the South Sea Company. The
recent disclosures led to his becoming first lord of the
treasury, and chancellor of the exchequer, with his
brother-in-law Townshend as secretary of state. In
March, 1722, the first septennial Parliament came to
an end, and again the Whigs were returned by an
overwhelming majority.<a name="FNanchor_56" id="FNanchor_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a> Walpole thus found himself
absolute master of the field, and this position he
continued to maintain for twenty years.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Jacobite
Conspiracy,
1722.</div>

<p>In the meanwhile the birth of an heir<a name="FNanchor_57" id="FNanchor_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a> to the
Pretender (1721) had raised the hopes of the Jacobites,
who were only waiting for a fitting opportunity to
renew their attack upon the House of Hanover. The
confusion which followed the bursting of the South
Sea Bubble seemed to afford them the opportunity
they desired. Again the aid of France was invoked.
Not only did the Regent refuse assistance, however,
but he informed the English minister in Paris of the
conspiracy that was on foot. Thus it was that on
the 8th May (1722) Townshend informed the Lord
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>Mayor (Sir William Stewart) by letter<a name="FNanchor_58" id="FNanchor_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a> that the king
had the best of grounds for believing that another
plot was being prepared in favour of the Pretender,
but that as the plot was unsupported by any foreign
power, and the king had been forewarned, there
would be little to fear. At the same time the king
looked to the mayor and his fellow magistrates to
secure the city.</p>

<div class="sidenote">City address
to the king,
9 May, 1722.</div>

<p>The letter being the next day brought to the
notice of the Court of Aldermen, that body prepared
a loyal address to the king and presented it to him
the same evening.<a name="FNanchor_59" id="FNanchor_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a> In acknowledging the address
the king assured the deputation that his interests and
the interests of the City were inseparable, that he
would do all in his power to maintain public credit
and protect the City's privileges and estate as well as
uphold the religion, laws and liberties of the kingdom.
An order was issued the same day by the
Privy Council for putting into execution the laws
against papists, reputed papists and non-jurors, as
well as against riots and tumults.<a name="FNanchor_60" id="FNanchor_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a> In addition to
this the Habeas Corpus Act was suspended for a
whole year, the longest time on record, and throughout
the summer troops were kept encamped ready
for any emergency. Some of the chief conspirators
in England, among them being Atterbury, Bishop
of Rochester, were placed under arrest. Had not the
conspiracy been timely discovered and precautions
taken the whole kingdom "and particularly the City
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>of London"&mdash;as George told the new parliament
when, after frequent prorogations, it met in October&mdash;might
have become involved in blood and confusion.<a name="FNanchor_61" id="FNanchor_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a>
As matters turned out, the conspiracy proved a complete
failure.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Bill for regulating
elections
in the
city, Jan.,
1725.</div>

<p>Whilst Walpole continued to pursue his policy
of peace and increased in influence year by year, the
City found itself constantly involved in disputed elections.
At one time it was an election of an alderman,
at another a member of the Common Council, at
another an election of a sheriff. At length matters
arrived at such a pitch that a petition from the
citizens at large was presented to the House of
Commons (16 Dec., 1724)<a name="FNanchor_62" id="FNanchor_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a> setting forth that, at
elections by the liverymen of the city, numbers of
people voted who had no right to vote; that at
wardmote elections non-freemen claimed the right
to vote on the ground that they contributed to the
charges of their respective wards, refusing at the same
time to qualify as voters by taking up the freedom
of the city because they would thereby restrict their
right of testamentary disposition of their estate;<a name="FNanchor_63" id="FNanchor_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a>
that the Court of Aldermen had decided (as we have
just seen) that payment of scot was a general contribution
to all the public taxes and charges upon the
city and inhabitants thereof&mdash;a decision which had
not met with the favour of the Common Council, and
that thus fresh causes of dissension between these two
bodies had recently arisen. The petitioners prayed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>therefore "the relief of the House for preserving the
liberties and peace and quieting the minds of the
citizens and for punishing all intruders upon their
rights and privileges, and settling their elections
upon a just and lasting foundation." In answer to
this prayer the House gave leave for the introduction
of a Bill "for regulating elections within the City
of London, and for preserving the peace, good order
and government of the said City."</p>

<div class="sidenote">Bill supported
by majority of
Aldermen.</div>

<p>After the Bill had been brought in (27 Jan., 1725),
two petitions were laid before the House; one purporting
to come from "the major part of the Aldermen
of the city," the other from the Common
Council.<a name="FNanchor_64" id="FNanchor_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a> The former, which was in favour of the
Bill, had been previously submitted to the Court
of Aldermen; but upon the question being proposed
that the petition should be the petition of the Court,
the lord mayor (Sir George Merttins) declined to put
the question on the ground that it would not be
consistent with his honour to let his name be inserted
in that petition, when already a petition had been
presented to parliament in the name of the Lord
Mayor, Aldermen and Commons in Common Council
assembled.<a name="FNanchor_65" id="FNanchor_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a> The aldermen's petition drew attention
more particularly to a clause in the Bill touching the
right of passing Acts or By-laws by the Common
Council. It declared that the right of the aldermen to
veto such proceedings had never been questioned until
the time of the civil war, and not afterwards until quite
recently; it further stated that the aldermen had
lately (20 Feb., 1724), by their recorder, proposed to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>the Common Council a settlement of all disputes by
reference either to the judges of the High Court or
the parliament; but the offer had been declined.<a name="FNanchor_66" id="FNanchor_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Bill opposed
by Common
Council.</div>

<p>The petition of the Common Council was against
the Bill as being destructive to many of the rights
and privileges which they and their fellow citizens
enjoyed by ancient charters.<a name="FNanchor_67" id="FNanchor_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a> The Bill passed its
second reading on the 6th of February, after which
both parties were heard by counsel. When the Bill
was before the committee, several petitions against it
were presented from Livery Companies of the city.
On the 19th March it was read a third time and
passed the Commons.<a name="FNanchor_68" id="FNanchor_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a> In the passage of the Bill
through the Lower House it had been strenuously
opposed by three out of the four members for the
city, viz: Francis Child, Richard Lockwood and
John Barnard. For their services in this respect the
Common Council passed (22 March) them a formal
vote of thanks. The Court at the same time prepared
to oppose the Bill in the Lords.<a name="FNanchor_69" id="FNanchor_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Election Act,
11 Geo. i. c, 18,
1725.</div>

<p>When the Bill was carried up to the Lords,
petitions from "the major part of the aldermen"
and from the Common Council were again presented,
as well as another petition subscribed by certain
freemen who objected to parts of the Bill.<a name="FNanchor_70" id="FNanchor_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a> The
passage of the Bill through the Upper House was
nevertheless expeditious; on the 1st April it was read
a second time and committed, and on the 13th, it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>was passed with some amendments, but not without
a protest being formally entered by dissentient lords.<a name="FNanchor_71" id="FNanchor_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a>
On the 20th the Bill received the royal assent.</p>

<p>There are three clauses in the Act of special
interest. First, the clause (No. ix), which prescribes
the nature of the charges embraced in the term
"payment of scot;" secondly, the clause (No. xv),
which confirms to the Aldermen of the city their
right to negative Acts of the Common Council;<a name="FNanchor_72" id="FNanchor_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a> and
thirdly, the clause (No. xvii) abolishing the custom
of the City restraining citizens and freemen from disposing
of the whole of their personal estates by will.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Death of
George I,
11 June, 1727.</div>

<p>Just when the reign of George I was drawing to
an unexpected close, it seemed as if England was on
the point of becoming involved in a European War.
The emperor and the king of Spain had laid aside
their quarrels and become united in a confederacy
against France and England. Unless Gibraltar were
ceded by England, another invasion of the Pretender
might be shortly expected. The citizens were highly
incensed at the thought of their trade being
periodically put in jeopardy by Jacobite risings, and
they hastened to assure the king once more of their
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>determination to sacrifice their lives and fortunes in
defence of the constitution both in church and state
against all enemies whatsoever.<a name="FNanchor_73" id="FNanchor_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a> Thanks to the
pacific tendencies of Walpole and the diplomatic skill
of Townshend, hostilities were averted, and George
was able to set out for his customary visit to Hanover,
where he had been in the habit of spending a portion
of each year. Before his journey was completed,
however, he was seized with apoplexy and died in
his coach, near Osnabr&uuml;ck (11 June).</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXXVI" id="CHAPTER_XXXVI">CHAPTER XXXVI.</a></h2>


<div class="sidenote">King
George II
proclaimed,
15 June, 1727.</div>

<p>On the 15th June, 1727, the Court of Aldermen
were informed by Sir John Eyles, the lord mayor,
that he had received an order of council dated from
Leicester House (the residence of the Prince of
Wales) for his lordship and the Court to attend at
eleven o'clock the next morning at Temple Bar for
the purpose of proclaiming King George II. The
Court thereupon agreed to be present, and instructed
the lord mayor to see that they were allowed to
follow in the procession immediately after the lords
of the council.<a name="FNanchor_74" id="FNanchor_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a> Proclamation having been duly
made the mayor and aldermen, accompanied by the
Recorder, waited upon the king with an address,
and afterwards proceeded to pay their compliments
to the queen.<a name="FNanchor_75" id="FNanchor_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a> Another address had been drawn
up by a joint committee of aldermen and common
councilmen on behalf of the Common Council.
But when it was submitted for approval the aldermen
insisted upon exercising their right of veto&mdash;recently
confirmed by parliamentary authority&mdash;and
as they and the commons failed to agree on
the several clauses of the address it had to be
abandoned altogether. The mayor was asked to
summon another court, "in pursuance to common
usage and ancient right," to consider another address,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>but after consultation with the aldermen he declined
to accede to the request.<a name="FNanchor_76" id="FNanchor_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">The king's
coronation,
11 Oct., 1727.</div>

<p>The coronation did not take place until October.
The ceremony was one of far greater splendour than
that of George I, such pageants being "as pleasing to
the son as they were irksome to the father."<a name="FNanchor_77" id="FNanchor_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a> The
City put in its customary claims, which were duly
allowed. The manner in which these claims were
made, as set out in a report made to the Court of
Aldermen by the city Remembrancer, whose duty it
was to make them, was shortly this. Having first
obtained the names of the masters of the twelve
superior companies, he put in two claims&mdash;written
on parchment, and stamped with a treble sixpenny
stamp&mdash;for the usual services in attendance upon the
king and queen. The claims being allowed, he
obtained certificates to that effect, and on presenting
them at the lord great chamberlain's office he received
warrants to the master of the king's jewel office for
two gold cups, each weighing 21 ozs. One of these,
the king's cup, he conveyed to the lord mayor; the
other, the queen's cup, he left until after the ceremony,
"for note"&mdash;says he&mdash;"they were not nor are
they used to be carryed down to Westminster Hall to
be made use of on that solemnity." The coronation
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>over, the Remembrancer applied for and received
from the Clerk of the Crown a copy of the judgments
on the several claims.<a name="FNanchor_78" id="FNanchor_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">The lord
mayor's
banquet,
28 Oct., 1727.</div>

<p>According to custom the king attended the first
lord mayor's banquet after his accession. He was
accompanied by the queen, the royal family, the
great officers of state, and a large number of the
nobility.<a name="FNanchor_79" id="FNanchor_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a> The entertainment was signalised by what
appears to have been a barefaced attempt at extortion
on the part of the king's own cup-bearer who made a
claim on the City for a silver cup (or its value) by way
of fee. The matter having been brought to the notice
of the Court of Aldermen, the Town Clerk was instructed
to search the city's Records for precedents,
and upon his reporting that he had failed to find one
the claim was dismissed.<a name="FNanchor_80" id="FNanchor_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a> The new king, like his
father, ordered &pound;1,000 to be paid to the sheriff for the
relief of insolvent debtors.<a name="FNanchor_81" id="FNanchor_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Portraits of
king and
queen.</div>

<p>The day that the king was invited to the lord
mayor's banquet the Common Council resolved to set
up his statue at the Royal Exchange.<a name="FNanchor_82" id="FNanchor_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a> Eventually they
commissioned Charles Jervas, an Irish painter and
pupil of Kneller, to paint portraits both of the king
and queen for the Guildhall. Jervas had been
originally apprenticed to a frame maker, and this
may account for the anxiety he displayed to put the
portraits into better frames than was usual. To do
this he asked for and obtained the consent of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>Court of Aldermen.<a name="FNanchor_83" id="FNanchor_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a> The pictures now hang in the
members' reading room at the Guildhall.<a name="FNanchor_84" id="FNanchor_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Walpole and
the queen.</div>

<p>For a short time after the king's accession it
appeared as if Walpole's ascendancy was to be
suddenly cut short. The minister was fortunate,
however, in winning over the queen to his interests,
and her influence, combined with his own masterful
tact, turned the scale in his favour, and he was
allowed to remain at the head of affairs. Before
long he succeeded in gaining the entire confidence
of the king himself, but during the lifetime of the
queen it was chiefly to her that the minister turned
in times of difficulty. She was a woman of considerable
ability, and thoroughly appreciated Walpole,
and together they were able to avoid many political
pitfalls and to persistently carry out that policy of
peace which characterised the whole of this reign.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Dissenters
and the
Corporation
and Test Acts,
1730.</div>

<p>Thus it was that in 1730, when the government
was placed in an unpleasant dilemma over an attempt
that was being made by Dissenters throughout the
country to obtain the repeal of the Corporation and
Test Acts Walpole took counsel with the queen, and
these two laid a plan with Hoadley, Bishop of Salisbury,
for getting the Dissenters to postpone bringing
their petition before parliament. The plan as we
learn from Lord Hervey,<a name="FNanchor_85" id="FNanchor_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a> who had every means of
making himself acquainted with the inner workings
of the Court of George II, was this. Hoadley, in
whom the Dissenters placed much confidence as an
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>avowed advocate of ecclesiastical as well as civil
liberty, was to do all he could to persuade them to
postpone, at least for a short time, their petition
to parliament, whilst Walpole was to see that the
committee of London Dissenters, which was to be
chosen to confer with government, should comprise
none but creatures of his own. The scheme succeeded
entirely. The Dissenters were hoodwinked. The
packed committee went through the form of an interview
with the ministers, and in due course reported to
the general assembly of Dissenters that the time was
inopportune for petitioning parliament. The general
body agreed, and the ministry was thus saved.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The City and
Walpole's
Excise Bill,
1733.</div>

<p>Although it was chiefly as a financier that the great
minister, under whom England enjoyed an unexampled
period of peace and prosperity, excelled, it was a
financial reform that nearly brought him to ruin three
years later. This was his famous Excise Bill. In a
hasty desire to curry favour with the landowners by
reducing the Land Tax Walpole proposed to establish
a new system of levying duties on tobacco and wine.
The tax itself was not new, but only the manner of
levying it. Hitherto the duty on wine and tobacco
had been payable on importation. The new proposal
was that these commodities should be allowed to lie
in bonded warehouses duty free until taken out for
home consumption, when their sale was to be restricted
to shops licensed for the purpose. In other words
the customs' duties on these commodities were to be
changed into excise duties, a form of taxation especially
hateful in those days, as seeming to infringe the rights
of the subject by giving revenue officers the right of
entering and searching houses at any hour without<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
further warrant. The City and the country were up
in arms, and the city members of parliament were
instructed to oppose the Bill for reasons set out in
writing and delivered into their hands.<a name="FNanchor_86" id="FNanchor_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a></p>

<p>Walpole delayed bringing in the Bill as long as
he could in hopes that the clamour against it&mdash;"epidemic
madness," as Hervey called it&mdash;might
subside. Neither London nor the kingdom, however,
would listen to reason, and the universal cry was
<i>No slavery&mdash;no excise&mdash;no wooden shoes!</i><a name="FNanchor_87" id="FNanchor_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a> When the
Bill was at last introduced (14 March) it met with
violent opposition, and more particularly from two of
the city members, viz., Sir John Barnard and Micaiah
Perry. During the debate the doors of the House
were besieged by such a noisy crowd that Walpole in
an unguarded moment characterised the mob as
"sturdy beggars." This at once brought Barnard
to his feet, and although there was at first a disposition
not to hear him, as he had already spoken
to the Bill, the House was prevailed upon to give him
a second hearing, owing to his position as a representative
of "the greatest and richest city in Europe,"
and a city greatly interested in the issues of the
debate. Barnard thereupon took Walpole severely
to task for the expression he had let drop. "The
honourable gentleman," said he, "talks of sturdy
beggars; I do not know what sort of people may
be now at the door, because I have not lately been
out of the House, but I believe they are the same
sort of people that were there when I came last into
the House, and then I can assure you that I saw
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>none but such as deserve the name of sturdy beggars
as little as the honourable gentleman himself, or any
gentleman whatever." Sturdy beggars or not (he
declared in conclusion) they could not legally be
prevented from coming down to the House. After
some further debate Walpole gained the day, and on
the 4th April the Bill was read a first time.<a name="FNanchor_88" id="FNanchor_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a></p>

<p>Before the Bill came on for its second reading a
copy of it had been laid before the Common Council
(9 April), and a petition had thereupon been drawn
up and presented to the House asking that the City
might be heard by counsel against the Bill.<a name="FNanchor_89" id="FNanchor_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a> After
long debate the prayer of the petition was refused,
but only by a bare majority of seventeen.<a name="FNanchor_90" id="FNanchor_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a> By this
time the clamour had become so great, even the army
showing signs of disaffection, that Walpole, true to
his principle of expediency, the key-note of his policy,
resolved to purchase peace by concession. He postponed
the further consideration of the Bill (11 April)
for a period of two months, and afterwards withdrew
it altogether. On leaving the House the day
that the motion for postponement was carried the
minister was mobbed. The affair was little more
than an "accidental scuffle," but it was studiously
represented to parliament as "a deep-laid scheme for
assassination." Resolutions were passed condemning
in strong terms all actors and abettors of the outrage,
and the city members were especially directed to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>carry copies to the lord mayor for publication within
his jurisdiction&mdash;the City being considered as the real
author of all the mischief.<a name="FNanchor_91" id="FNanchor_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Mayoralty of
Sir William
Billers, 1733-1734.</div>

<p>The defeat of the Bill was received with
extravagant joy, and in 1734 it was proposed to
celebrate its anniversary in the city with bonfires.
For this purpose subscriptions were invited through
the medium of the press. The mayor, Sir William
Billers, on learning this consulted the Court of
Aldermen as to what was best to be done under the
circumstances, and by their advice he issued his
precept for a special watch to be kept, and for the
arrest of all persons attempting to make bonfires or
to create disorder.<a name="FNanchor_92" id="FNanchor_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a> Notwithstanding this precaution
a riot broke out, and Billers not only had his windows
broken, on account of his obnoxious precept, but was
himself pelted with dirt and stones, whilst patrolling
the streets in company with the Swordbearer. Insult
was added to injury by the newspapers of the day
holding him up as having himself been the real
cause of all the disorder. The Court of Aldermen,
on the other hand, accorded him a hearty vote of
thanks for the courage he had displayed.<a name="FNanchor_93" id="FNanchor_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a> On going
out of office Billers again became an object of
attack, the mob pelting him with all kinds of filth
and endeavouring to smash his coach. The Court
of Aldermen were so indignant at this outrage that
they offered a reward of &pound;50 for every offender
brought to justice.<a name="FNanchor_94" id="FNanchor_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a></p>

<p>In 1734 the princess royal was married to the
Prince of Orange, and two years later the Prince
of Wales married the Princess Augusta of Saxe-Gotha.
On both occasions the City presented
congratulatory addresses.<a name="FNanchor_95" id="FNanchor_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a> Lord Hervey, the king's
vice-chamberlain, was highly indignant at the first
address because of the reference it made to King
William III. But if the City sinned in this respect it
sinned in good company, for Oxford University and
other corporate bodies made similar allusions. "The
city of London," wrote Hervey,<a name="FNanchor_96" id="FNanchor_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a> "the University of
Oxford, and several other disaffected towns and
incorporated bodies took the opportunity of the
princess royal's marriage to say the most impertinent
things to the king, under the pretence of
complimental addresses, that ironical zeal and
couched satire could put together. The tenor of
them all was to express their satisfaction in this
match from remembering how much this country
was indebted to a prince who bore the title of
Orange, declaring their gratitude to his memory,
and intimating as plainly as they dared, how much
they wished this man might follow the example of
his great ancestor, and one time or other <i>depose his
father-in-law</i> in the same manner that King William
had deposed his." Happily the king took a more
sensible view of the address, and vouchsafed a gracious
reply. So far from being offended at the City's allusion
to William of Orange he was pleased. "It is a
great pleasure to me," he said, "to see this great

deliverance of these kingdoms from popery and
slavery by my great predecessor King William."<a name="FNanchor_97" id="FNanchor_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a>

<div class="sidenote">Disputes
between
England and
Spain in the
West Indies.</div>

<p>For nearly twenty years England had enjoyed
uninterrupted peace at home and abroad. The last
action in which an English force had been engaged
had taken place in the summer of 1718, when
Admiral Byng defeated a Spanish fleet off Cape
Passaro. Since then trade had been flourishing, and
the city merchant had been busily sending cargoes of
English merchandise across the sea to the West Indies,
paying little regard to the restrictions imposed on them
by the provisions of the Treaty of Utrecht.<a name="FNanchor_99" id="FNanchor_99"></a><a href="#Footnote_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Jenkin's ear,
1738.</div>

<p>Spain on the other hand insisted upon the right
of search, and their coastguards had often seized
English vessels suspected of smuggling, and were
sometimes reported as having brutally ill-used their
crews.<a name="FNanchor_100" id="FNanchor_100"></a><a href="#Footnote_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a> Matters were fast tending to an open rupture
when the episode of Jenkin's ear roused an intense
desire for war both in the city and the country generally.
The story is well known. Jenkin was master of a
small trading vessel which seven years before had been
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>overhauled by a Spanish guarda-costa. Irritated at
finding nothing contraband on board the Spanish
commander is said to have cut off one of Jenkin's
ears, bidding him carry it to the king. Jenkin took
advantage of the prevalent feeling against Spain to
exhibit his ear wrapt in cotton wool, and when asked
as to his feelings at the time of the outrage declared
that he had commended his soul to God and his cause
to his country. This clap-trap story&mdash;it is shrewdly
suspected that Jenkin lost his ear in the pillory&mdash;had
the desired effect. Popular indignation was roused,
and the nation clamoured for war.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The City and
the Spanish
Convention,
1739.</div>

<p>To all this Walpole turned a deaf ear, and instead
of proclaiming war opened negotiations for peace. A
Convention with Spain was agreed to, but as it left
the question as to right of search still unsettled, great
opposition was displayed, both in and out of parliament,
to its ratification. The minister was in the greatest
straits. His best friend and supporter, the queen, had
recently died, and the king, freed from the peaceful
influence of his wife, as well as the City, were urging
war. It was not often that the Londoners called for
war, they were too interested in commercial pursuits
not to appreciate to the full the blessings of peace.
But on this occasion the City felt bound to make a
strong representation to parliament as to "the fatal
consequences of leaving the freedom of navigation
any longer in suspense and uncertainty." They had
too much reason to fear (they said) that if the right
claimed by Spain of searching British ships at sea were
admitted in any degree "the trade of his majesty's
subjects to America will become so precarious as to
depend in a great measure upon the indulgence and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
justice of the Spaniards, of both which they have
given us for some years past such specimens as we
humbly think this nation can have no cause to be
satisfied with."<a name="FNanchor_101" id="FNanchor_101"></a><a href="#Footnote_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a> The citizens were probably right,
although they were held up to much ridicule for venturing
to give advice upon affairs of state. During the
debate on the convention, lists of the members of the
Common Council, with their respective trades or companies,
were scattered abroad, and to these lists were
appended texts from scripture to the effect that however
useful such men might be in a city "they shall
not be sought for in public council."<a name="FNanchor_102" id="FNanchor_102"></a><a href="#Footnote_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">"Leonidas"
Glover.</div>

<p>One citizen in particular distinguished himself by
advocating war in a poem of greater length than merit.
This was Richard Glover,<a name="FNanchor_103" id="FNanchor_103"></a><a href="#Footnote_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a> known as "Leonidas"
Glover (from another poem he wrote bearing that
title), author of "London, or the Progress of Commerce,"
in which he reminds the citizens of their
former prowess at Newbury, and asks&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Shall we be now more timid, when behold,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The blackening storm now gathers round our heads<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And England's angry genius sounds to arms?"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Besides being an "eminent Hamburgh merchant"
and a writer of verse, Glover took an active part in
city elections, and was a strong upholder of the rights
of the livery. On Michaelmas-day, when Sir George
Champion, who sat for Aylesbury, was put in nomination
for the mayoralty and rejected chiefly, if not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>wholly, on account of his having voted for the Convention,<a name="FNanchor_104" id="FNanchor_104"></a><a href="#Footnote_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a>
Glover was asked to move a vote of thanks to
the city members, for having opposed the Convention.
This he did in a spirited speech, in which he referred
to Champion's chance of election to the mayoralty as
being in all probability for ever lost, a prediction which
proved true.<a name="FNanchor_105" id="FNanchor_105"></a><a href="#Footnote_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">War declared
with Spain,
19 Oct., 1739.</div>

<p>Although the Convention was carried, it became
apparent that either war must be declared or
Walpole resign. The minister's love of power
overcame his convictions, and he allowed himself to
be dragged into a war which he felt at the time
to be unjustifiable and foreboding of evil. The declaration
of war which was made in October was
welcomed with peals of bells from London churches.
"They ring their bells now," said he, "before long
they will be wringing their hands." When the
outgoing mayor received instructions from the Duke
of Newcastle to assist at the proclamation of war
according to custom, he demurred on the ground that
the town clerk had been unable to find a precedent
for the Court of Aldermen attending a proclamation
of war; but upon the Duke referring him to what
had taken place when war was declared in 1718
against Spain, the objection was withdrawn. A
question next arose as to the place the civic
authorities should occupy in the procession, and the
Remembrancer was instructed to make enquiries on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>the point both at the secretary's office and the
Heralds' College. The information gathered by him
proving unsatisfactory, the Court of Aldermen took
it upon themselves to decide that the civic party
should fall in immediately after Garter King-at-Arms.
This order, however, was not carried out, for the
Horse Guards thrust themselves into the procession
in front of the municipal officers.<a name="FNanchor_106" id="FNanchor_106"></a><a href="#Footnote_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Capture of
Porto Bello,
Nov., 1739.</div>

<p>At the outset of the war fortune favoured British
arms, and in November, Admiral Vernon succeeded
in surprising and capturing the town of Porto Bello,
situate on the Isthmus of Darien (Panama). The
City was delighted and presented the king with the
usual congratulatory address.<a name="FNanchor_107" id="FNanchor_107"></a><a href="#Footnote_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a> Such a feat the citizens
declared would not only serve to show that the
maritime power of the country, although allowed to
lie dormant so long, was still capable of vindicating
the honour of the crown, but also gave promise of
future successes, and they assured the king that he
might depend upon them to contribute towards the
support of a war so necessary for the protection
of their long injured trade.</p>

<div class="sidenote">"Admiral

<p>As for Vernon, he became a popular idol with
the citizens, who continued to look upon his single
success whilst they turned a blind eye to his many
subsequent failures. Not only was he presented with
the Freedom of the City in a gold box, but his birthday
was for some years kept with general rejoicing.<a name="FNanchor_108" id="FNanchor_108"></a><a href="#Footnote_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a>
His capture of Porto Bello was made the subject of a
poem by Glover&mdash;his one readable ballad&mdash;under the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>title of "Admiral Hosier's Ghost," in which Vernon's
good fortune is compared with the ill-luck which
attended Hosier's expedition to the West Indies in
1726, when, doomed to inaction by orders from home,
that gallant officer saw the greater part of his men
swept off by disease, and he himself died subsequently
of a broken heart.<a name="FNanchor_109" id="FNanchor_109"></a><a href="#Footnote_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Heathcote
discharged
Mayor by
Common
Council,
Oct., 1740.</div>

<p>When Michaelmas-day again came round Glover
was again to the fore. It was customary for the livery
to hold a preliminary meeting either at the London
Tavern or some company's hall before they met
in Common Hall. On this occasion the meeting was
held in Vintners' Hall, and Glover took the chair.
The business of the day having been opened by a
speech from the chairman, in which he referred to
the rejection of Sir George Champion the previous
year, and exhorted them to choose a mayor for the
year ensuing who would be agreeable to the majority
of the citizens, the livery proceeded to choose Sir
Robert Godschall and George Heathcote, although
they were not the senior aldermen below the chair.<a name="FNanchor_110" id="FNanchor_110"></a><a href="#Footnote_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a>
There names were accordingly submitted to the full
body of the livery assembled in Common Hall on
Michaelmas-day and were accepted.<a name="FNanchor_111" id="FNanchor_111"></a><a href="#Footnote_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a> It now became
the duty of the Court of Aldermen to select one of
these two to be mayor for the year ensuing. Godschall
was the senior, and Heathcote particularly
desired not to be chosen on the plea of ill-health,
and because he had so recently served sheriff.
Nevertheless the choice of the aldermen was declared
to be for Heathcote, although he repeated his request
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>not to serve. A Common Council was thereupon summoned
to consider the matter, and it was eventually
resolved that Heathcote should be discharged without
fine.<a name="FNanchor_112" id="FNanchor_112"></a><a href="#Footnote_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Humphrey
Parsons
re-elected
Mayor,
Oct., 1740.</div>

<p>This necessitated the summoning another Common
Hall, and another accordingly met on the
14th October. A preliminary meeting of the livery
took place, as before, at Vintners' Hall, and again
Glover was in the chair. The action of the Court of
Aldermen in thus passing over Godschall merely
because the livery had refused to nominate Champion,
was strongly condemned by the chairman, who no
less strongly eulogised the action of Heathcote
for refusing to serve&mdash;a refusal which emanated,
according to the speaker, not from ill-health, but
from a determination not to fill the place of the
rejected Godschall.<a name="FNanchor_113" id="FNanchor_113"></a><a href="#Footnote_113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a> When the election came on in
Common Hall the livery returned Godschall for the
third time, and with him Humphrey Parsons who had
served mayor ten years before. Again Godschall
was passed over by the Court of Aldermen, and
Parsons was called to the mayoralty chair for the
second time, although by the bare majority of one
vote.<a name="FNanchor_114" id="FNanchor_114"></a><a href="#Footnote_114" class="fnanchor">[114]</a></p>

<p>The Common Council were desirous (22 Oct.) of
passing a vote of thanks to Parsons for again accepting
a laborious and expensive office, "<i>and thereby
endeavouring in some measure to restore the peace and
tranquility of this city which has been greatly disturbed
by a late extraordinary and unusual proceeding</i>." A
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>A long debate arose, some of the aldermen present
insisting upon their right of a negative voice in the
matter; and upon the question being put to them,
the words in <i>italics</i> were vetoed by twelve aldermen
to one.<a name="FNanchor_115" id="FNanchor_115"></a><a href="#Footnote_115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a> Those aldermen who had previously voted

<div class="sidenote">A general

<p>In 1741 a general election took place. Parsons,

by Daniel Lambert.<a name="FNanchor_117" id="FNanchor_117"></a><a href="#Footnote_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a> Barnard retained his seat, and

<div class="sidenote">City petitions

<p>Early in the following year two petitions were

and was presented to Parliament by Godschall,<a name="FNanchor_118" id="FNanchor_118"></a><a href="#Footnote_118" class="fnanchor">[118]</a> who

referred to a committee of the whole House, with

<p>Whilst these petitions were under consideration
the ministry suffered a defeat over an election petition,
and Walpole resigned (17 Feb.). With the great

The Common Council had, previously (10 Feb.)
made a "representation" to the city members urging
them to promote a Place Bill and a Pension Bill, as
well as the repeal of the Septennial Act, and so secure
the constitution "against all future attempts either of
open or secret corruption or of any undue influence

<div class="sidenote">The City and

<p>After some difficulty a new ministry was formed
in which Carteret soon became the leading man. The
City continued to look for the execution of the long-wished-for
reforms, but looked in vain. It was the old
story. Men who when out of office breathed the spirit
of patriotism and virtue were anything but virtuous
and patriotic in office. Again were the city members
urged by another "representation" to press forward
certain measures and not to vote supplies until the
government showed some signs of moving in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>direction required.<a name="FNanchor_123" id="FNanchor_123"></a><a href="#Footnote_123" class="fnanchor">[123]</a> The example of the City was
followed in other places, and copies of the "representation"
were freely circulated in all parts of the
country. The newspapers of the day, whilst lamenting
the condition into which the country had fallen through
"the iniquitous administration of the late corrupter,"
expressed their confidence that the example set by
London&mdash;"the source and fountain head of all our
wealth and trade"&mdash;would continue to have, as it
had already had, its proper influence both within and
without doors.<a name="FNanchor_124" id="FNanchor_124"></a><a href="#Footnote_124" class="fnanchor">[124]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">France and

<p>When Carteret came into power, Europe was
distracted with the war of the Austrian succession,
and before long England was drawn into the vortex.
Whilst France embraced the cause of the Elector of
Bavaria, England supported Maria Theresa. In June,
1743, the French army was defeated at Dettingen,
when, for the last time, a king of England appeared
in the field of battle at the head of his men, and bore
himself right royally. Louis retaliated by promising
assistance to Charles Edward Stuart, known in history
as the Young Pretender, who meditated an invasion
of England to claim the crown.</p>

<div class="sidenote">War declared

<p>Information of the project having been communicated

promising him their utmost support, and the next day
the Common Council voted a similar address.<a name="FNanchor_125" id="FNanchor_125"></a><a href="#Footnote_125" class="fnanchor">[125]</a> The

to Godschall's seat in Parliament as one of the members
for the city. Before the end of the month the
lord mayor was informed by letter from the Privy
Council that extensive preparations were being made
at Dunkirk, in concert with disaffected persons in this
country, for an invasion, and it behoved his lordship
to put into operation the Acts against papists and
non-jurors.<a name="FNanchor_127" id="FNanchor_127"></a><a href="#Footnote_127" class="fnanchor">[127]</a> The aspect of affairs began to look black

Walpole to his friend, "it must be a bloody war."<a name="FNanchor_128" id="FNanchor_128"></a><a href="#Footnote_128" class="fnanchor">[128]</a>
The danger that seemed so imminent passed away

<div class="sidenote">The Pretender

<p>Though bitterly disappointed at the failure of this
expedition the prince did not lose courage, but resolved
in the following year (1745) to cross over to Scotland
unsupported by France, and to trust to the loyalty of
his friends there. Landing in the western highlands
with a mere handful of followers he gradually drew to
his side a small force, and on the 19th August set up
his standard in Glenfinnan. On the 4th September
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>the Duke of Newcastle (brother of Pelham, who had
recently succeeded Carteret in the premiership)
informed the lord mayor by letter of the Pretender
having set up his standard and of his then being on
his way to Perth or Edinburgh. The king was
assured, he said, that the mayor would do his utmost
to preserve the peace and the security of the city.<a name="FNanchor_131" id="FNanchor_131"></a><a href="#Footnote_131" class="fnanchor">[131]</a>
Both the Common Council and the Court of Aldermen
presented addresses to the king in testimony of their
loyalty to the constitution of Church and State, and
both bodies in return received assurances of royal
favour and promises of protection for their trade and
commerce.<a name="FNanchor_132" id="FNanchor_132"></a><a href="#Footnote_132" class="fnanchor">[132]</a> The London merchant and trader had
been the greatest gainers by the Revolution and the
policy of peace pursued by Walpole. It would have
been base ingratitude, if nothing else, had the City
acted otherwise at this important crisis. Dr. Gardiner
points out that it was much the same in Scotland, and
that the traders there, having profited by the Union,
were to a man staunch Hanoverians.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Pretender's

<p>On the 17th September the prince entered

and thus encouraged he prepared to cross the border

not been for the praiseworthy promptitude of the
leading London merchants who met and passed a
formal resolution pledging themselves to support the

<div class="sidenote">The Pretender

<p>Again fortune favoured England. The prince
delayed his march so long, collecting money and

London into a state of defence. A camp was formed
at Finchley<a name="FNanchor_134" id="FNanchor_134"></a><a href="#Footnote_134" class="fnanchor">[134]</a> to intercept the rebels, and subscription
lists were opened in London and the country for the

the fund,<a name="FNanchor_135" id="FNanchor_135"></a><a href="#Footnote_135" class="fnanchor">[135]</a> but England as a whole was strangely
apathetic. Carteret, the late prime minister, who
had, on the death of his mother recently, become
Viscount Carteret and Earl Granville, refused to subscribe
anything to the fund, and a similar indifference
to the country's danger was displayed by others of
the aristocracy.<a name="FNanchor_136" id="FNanchor_136"></a><a href="#Footnote_136" class="fnanchor">[136]</a> By Wednesday, the 4th December,

<p>The news of the rebels being within 150 miles

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>6th December&mdash;"Black Friday," as it came to be
called. The Duke of Newcastle immediately wrote
off to the lord mayor informing him of the fact of the
Pretender's forces having already reached Derby "in
their way, as they give out, towards London." The
Duke of Cumberland, the letter went on to say, was
making every effort to intercept the rebels at Northampton,
and part of his cavalry would be there that
night and the rest the next day, when the foot soldiers
were also expected. The mayor was desired to take
immediate steps, in the meantime, for the defence of
the city, in case the duke failed to place himself
between the rebels and London. The letter having
been communicated to a special Court of Aldermen
on Saturday it was resolved to issue precepts for
returns to be made by the following Monday of the
number of coach and saddle horses found in each ward.
The trained bands were to take up their quarters in
the Royal Exchange, whilst a portion of Bridewell
Hospital was to serve as a guard-room for the night
guard appointed by the commissioners of lieutenancy.
The two city marshals were to be instructed to visit
the night watches in the several wards and to see
that the constables did their duty.<a name="FNanchor_138" id="FNanchor_138"></a><a href="#Footnote_138" class="fnanchor">[138]</a> All was excitement
and activity. The king prepared to go to the
camp at Finchley to take command of the guards.
The weavers of London offered to supply him with
1,000 men, whilst the lawyers formed themselves

to avert bankruptcy. Instead of refusing payment
the Bank employed agents for the express purpose
of presenting notes which, in order to gain time, were
cashed in sixpences; "and as those who came first
were entitled to priority the agents went out at one
door with the specie they had received and brought
it back by another, so that the <i>bon&acirc; fide</i> holders of

<div class="sidenote">The Pretender
withdraws
from Derby.</div>

<p>Fortunately the crisis was soon over, the
Pretender had scarcely reached Derby before he
reluctantly accepted the advice of his commanders
and ordered a retreat. Under the circumstances it
was perhaps the best thing to do. The English
armies were gradually closing in upon him, this
country had shown no disposition to rise in his
favour, and the Duke of Cumberland was, as we have
seen, hastening towards Northampton to bar his
passage to the capital.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Freedom
of the City
for Duke of
Cumberland,
23 Jan., 1746.</div>

<p>The citizens were not slow to realise how much
they owed to the duke for their protection, and on
the 23rd January (1746) the Common Council
resolved to present him with the Freedom of the
City in a gold box, both for his "magnanimous"
behaviour against the rebels, as well as for his
vigilant care in protecting the city "in a late time of
imminent danger."<a name="FNanchor_141" id="FNanchor_141"></a><a href="#Footnote_141" class="fnanchor">[141]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Victory of
Culloden,
16 April, 1746.</div>

<p>Some time elapsed before the duke was able to
receive the freedom, for as soon as he was aware that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>the rebels were in retreat, he hurried off in pursuit.
After defeating General Hawley at Falkirk (17 Jan.,
1746) the rebels retired towards Inverness, but in April
they were brought to bay by the duke at Culloden
Moor and utterly defeated. The duke was a man of
violent passions, and his victory was marked with so
much wanton cruelty and bloodshed, that he acquired
the name of the Butcher. This name he never lost,
and when it came to his taking up the Freedom of
the City, some one was bold enough to suggest the
propriety of his becoming a member of the Butchers'
Company.<a name="FNanchor_142" id="FNanchor_142"></a><a href="#Footnote_142" class="fnanchor">[142]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">City address
to the king,
3 May, 1746.</div>

<p>Cruel as the duke's conduct had been, it had
the effect of crushing the rebellion. London and the
kingdom could once more breathe freely, and the
citizens could follow their commercial pursuits without
fear of further abortive attempts being made to
restore the crown to the Stuarts. Instead of blaming
the duke for his drastic measures, they applauded
him and formally thanked the king for giving him
the command, "Permit us, Sir"&mdash;they said, addressing
his majesty&mdash;"to return our most unfeigned thanks ...
for the appointment of his royal highness
the duke to this important service, whose conduct
and bravery (so early conspicuous) have by the
blessing of the Almighty produced this our happy
deliverance: a glory reserved for one of your
illustrious family, endowed with those princely
qualities which render him amiable to those under
his command, and formidable to his enemies."
They, at the same time assured his majesty that it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
would be always their firm resolution, no less than
their indispensable duty "to oppose every attempt of
the common disturbers of the peace of Europe"
against the rights of his crown.<a name="FNanchor_143" id="FNanchor_143"></a><a href="#Footnote_143" class="fnanchor">[143]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">The general
election, 1747.</div>

<p>One effect of the rebellion was to strengthen
the hands of the government. The subscription lists
that had been opened during the crisis were the
means of displaying to the world who were Jacobites
and who were not, and when the general election
came on in the summer of 1747 it went hard with
those who entertained Jacobite proclivities. Barnard
and Culvert retained their seats for the city, but
Slingsby Bethell and Stephen Theodore Janssen were
returned in place of Lambert and Heathcote. "Both
Westminster and Middlesex have elected court
candidates," wrote Walpole to his friend,<a name="FNanchor_144" id="FNanchor_144"></a><a href="#Footnote_144" class="fnanchor">[144]</a> "and the
city of London is taking the same step, the first
time of many years that the two latter have been
whig; but the non-subscribing at the time of the
rebellion, has been most successfully played off upon
the Jacobites."</p>

<div class="sidenote">Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle,
Oct., 1748.</div>

<p>The rebellion had also a considerable effect upon
the war on the continent, for the Austrians, deprived
of English succour, lost nearly the whole of their
possessions in the Netherlands to France. The
French, however, were unsuccessful in Italy, whilst
at sea the English navy attacked their colonial
possessions, and captured the island of Cape Breton.
All parties being ready to come to terms, a peace
was at length concluded (Oct., 1748) at Aix-la-Chapelle
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>on the general principle of restitution of

<div class="sidenote">The Newcastle
administration,
1754-1756.</div>

<p>From the time when Henry Pelham succeeded
Carteret (Nov., 1744) as Prime Minister, the strife of
parties was lulled by the simple expedient of admitting
into office any man capable of rendering himself
dangerous to the government. Pelham's administration
thus became distinguished as the Broad-bottomed
Administration. Upon his death in March, 1754, the
era of tranquillity passed away. He was succeeded
in the Premiership by his brother the Duke of
Newcastle. Already there was danger of war with
France, as well as opposition at home, but with the
assistance of Charles Fox, Newcastle contrived to
get through the year. Before another twelvemonth
had elapsed, however, England was again threatened
with a French invasion.<a name="FNanchor_146" id="FNanchor_146"></a><a href="#Footnote_146" class="fnanchor">[146]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">The National
Militia Bill,
1756.</div>

<p>On the 11th November (1755) the lords of the
council wrote to Slingsby Bethell, who had just
entered upon his mayoralty, instructing him to call
out the whole of the City's militia for immediate
service. The letter was laid before a special Court of
Aldermen on Saturday, the 15th, when it was resolved
to summon the Commissioners of Lieutenancy to meet
that afternoon, and a special court of Common Council
for the following Tuesday.<a name="FNanchor_147" id="FNanchor_147"></a><a href="#Footnote_147" class="fnanchor">[147]</a> The Common Council
having assembled on the day named the Lord Mayor
communicated to them the contents of the letter he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>had received. A motion was thereupon made for applying
to Parliament for a more effectual National Militia
Bill, but a debate arose, and the matter was adjourned
for further consideration. On the 25th the debate was
resumed, but upon being put to the vote the motion
was lost. Nevertheless, a Bill for better ordering the
militia of the country was introduced into Parliament
the following spring and passed (10 May, 1756), but
the City's militia was exempted from the Bill.<a name="FNanchor_148" id="FNanchor_148"></a><a href="#Footnote_148" class="fnanchor">[148]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Importation
of foreign
mercenaries.</div>

<p>Newcastle was not the man to conduct a great
war. A fresh election had taken place soon after his
appointment as first lord of the treasury, and the
result had given the ministry a handsome majority.
Nevertheless, so helpless was he that he could devise
no better plan for saving the country from invasion than
by importing Hessian and Hanoverian mercenaries.
Worse than this, his proposal was adopted, although
Pitt left a sick bed on purpose to go down to the
House and solemnly protest against such a course.<a name="FNanchor_149" id="FNanchor_149"></a><a href="#Footnote_149" class="fnanchor">[149]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">A tax on
plate opposed
by the City.</div>

<p>A proposal, made by the chancellor of the
exchequer, Sir George Lyttelton, to impose a tax upon
plate, for the purpose of raising supplies, was reasonable
enough, but it met with opposition not only from
Pitt but also from the City,<a name="FNanchor_150" id="FNanchor_150"></a><a href="#Footnote_150" class="fnanchor">[150]</a> partly on account of the
existing inland duties being already sufficiently heavy
and partly because this particular tax would teach
servants to become informers. At the same time the
citizens avowed themselves ready to hazard their lives
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>and their fortunes in support of the king and the Protestant
succession.<a name="FNanchor_151" id="FNanchor_151"></a><a href="#Footnote_151" class="fnanchor">[151]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">The loss of
Minorca,
1756.</div>

<p>The threatened invasion was only a trick played
by the French king to draw off attention from the
real object of attack&mdash;the capture of Minorca. Owing
to dilatoriness on the part of the ministry Byng was
despatched too late to save the island. This loss
excited the utmost indignation. The cry was loud
against the government, but louder still against
Byng, who was accused of rank cowardice, if not
treachery. Newcastle was content to make a scapegoat
of the admiral, and ordered him home under
arrest to await trial. The feeling of disgust which
prevailed in the city at Byng having withdrawn to
Gibraltar without hazarding a brush with the enemy
manifested itself by the display of a placard at the
Royal Exchange advertising <i>Three kingdoms to be let</i>.<a name="FNanchor_152" id="FNanchor_152"></a><a href="#Footnote_152" class="fnanchor">[152]</a>
Whilst Byng awaited his trial, popular clamour,
throughout the country rose to such a pitch that at
last war was declared (17 May, 1756). In August the
citizens again assured the king of their readiness to
shed their last drop of blood and contribute all that
might be necessary for the defence of the kingdom
and colonies, but they none the less expressed an
eager hope that Byng and those who were responsible
for losses in America should be brought to punishment.<a name="FNanchor_153" id="FNanchor_153"></a><a href="#Footnote_153" class="fnanchor">[153]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">A "representation"
to
city members,
Oct., 1756.</div>

<p>The recent failures and the general weakness and
incapacity of Newcastle irritated the country to such
a degree that the ministry became frightened, and in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>October (1756) Fox, who for the last year had
undertaken the duties of the leadership in the House
of Commons, resigned. At this juncture the Common
Council again drew up a "representation" for the
guidance of the city's representatives in parliament.<a name="FNanchor_154" id="FNanchor_154"></a><a href="#Footnote_154" class="fnanchor">[154]</a>
First and foremost they were to insist upon a strict and
impartial parliamentary enquiry into the causes of the
recent disasters at Minorca and in North America,
which had rendered the British name contemptible;
and in the next place they were to seize the earliest
opportunity of urging the necessity of establishing a
constitutional militia and of ridding the country of
those foreign mercenaries, whose numbers had been
constantly increasing, whose support had become an
intolerable expense, and who claimed to be above the
law of the land. They were to vote for no supplies
until this were done. They were further instructed
to endeavour to limit the number of placemen and
pensioners, which of late had so remarkably increased;
to restore at a proper season triennial parliaments, as
being the only means of obtaining a free representative
of the people; to keep an eye on the proper application
of public money; and finally to see that the
country did not become involved in continental affairs
so as to threaten its independence.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Newcastle
succeeded by
Pitt, Nov.,
1756.</div>

<p>This representation was not without its effect.
In November Newcastle resigned, and Pitt, although
nominally only secretary of state under the Duke of
Devonshire, became virtually prime minister. He had
not been many weeks in office before he gratified the
City by sending the Hanoverian and Hessian troops<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
out of the country, as well as by passing a Bill for
re-organising the national militia.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Execution of
Admiral Byng,
14 March,
1757.</div>

<p>Just as the year was drawing to a close Byng was
brought to trial. Owing to a comparatively recent
change that had been made in the articles of war the
court found itself compelled to bring in a verdict of
guilty without any imputation on the personal courage
of the admiral.<a name="FNanchor_155" id="FNanchor_155"></a><a href="#Footnote_155" class="fnanchor">[155]</a> The extent of his criminality was
that he had failed to do all that might have been
done to save Minorca. Pitt, who was no favourite
with the king, was courageous enough to plead for a
royal pardon, but the king turned a deaf ear. The
country deemed itself betrayed, and called for a victim.
The timorous Newcastle had long promised a deputation
of citizens that Byng should be speedily brought
to justice. "Oh! indeed he shall be tried immediately,
he shall be hanged directly."<a name="FNanchor_156" id="FNanchor_156"></a><a href="#Footnote_156" class="fnanchor">[156]</a> The trial had
taken place, and although the court that tried him
had shown an unmistakable desire to treat him with
leniency, the City began to show signs of impatience
and clamoured for his death. Papers bearing the
words "Shoot Byng, or take care of your king" are
even said to have appeared posted up in the Royal
Exchange.<a name="FNanchor_157" id="FNanchor_157"></a><a href="#Footnote_157" class="fnanchor">[157]</a> The citizens had their wish. The sentence
was carried out, and Byng was shot on the quarterdeck
of the "Monarque" at Portsmouth (14 March,
1757).</p>

<div class="sidenote">Civic honours
for Pitt and
Legge,
24 May, 1757.</div>

<p>Soon after this Pitt was dismissed. His dismissal
was the signal for a general ebullition in his favour.
The Common Council presented both him and Legge
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>(who had served under him as chancellor of the
exchequer) with the Freedom of the City and gold
boxes, in testimony of their conduct during their
"honourable tho' short administration." The City
declared its appreciation of the noble efforts of these
ministers "to stem the general torrent of corruption
and revive by their example the almost extinguished
love of virtue and our country," their zeal in promoting
a full and impartial enquiry into the real causes of
the late disasters in America and the Mediterranean,
and lastly their efforts to support the glory and
independence of Great Britain, the true interests
of the crown and the rights and liberties of the
subject.<a name="FNanchor_158" id="FNanchor_158"></a><a href="#Footnote_158" class="fnanchor">[158]</a> The example thus set by the city of
London was followed by other corporations in such
quick succession that for some weeks, as Lady Hervey
wittily remarked, "it rained gold boxes."</p>

<div class="sidenote">Coalition of
Pitt and
Newcastle,
June, 1757.</div>

<p>The king tried to get Newcastle, with his subservient
band of supporters, to accept office again, but
the duke could not make up his mind whether to
resume office or not, and for nearly three months the
country was without any ministry at all. At last a
compromise was arranged in June between Pitt and
Newcastle,<a name="FNanchor_159" id="FNanchor_159"></a><a href="#Footnote_159" class="fnanchor">[159]</a> whereby the former undertook all affairs
of state, leaving to Newcastle the business of patronage,
such as his soul loved. Pitt threw himself heartily
into the war, determined to raise the national spirit.
His task, however, was a difficult one, owing to the
incompetency of those he found in command. Thus,
for instance, an attempt to take Rochefort failed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>through dissension between Admiral Hawke and
General Mordaunt. The Common Council were on
the point of considering the advisability of addressing
the king on the subject, when the mayor informed
them that one of the clerks of the Privy Council had
waited on him at the Mansion House to inform him
that directions had already been given for an enquiry
into the cause of the recent miscarriage; and so the
matter was allowed to drop.<a name="FNanchor_160" id="FNanchor_160"></a><a href="#Footnote_160" class="fnanchor">[160]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Subscriptions
for bounties,
1759-1760.</div>

<p>Thanks to Pitt's military reforms and to the
confidence he inspired, the remainder of the reign
was marked by a series of successes culminating in
the conquest of Canada. In the summer of 1759 the
French again threatened an invasion, but it caused no
alarm. A new spirit had been breathed into the
nation and animated both services. The City resolved
to open a subscription list at the Guildhall for encouraging
the enlistment of recruits, and to contribute
&pound;1,000 towards the fund. By way of further encouragement
the Freedom of the City was offered
gratuitously to every soldier who should produce to
the chamberlain a testimonial of his good behaviour
during his term of service, and who should wish to
be admitted to the privilege of exercising a trade
within the city and liberties. A committee was
appointed to make the necessary arrangements for
carrying out the enlistments, and Pitt was desired to
lay these resolutions before his majesty as an humble
testimony of the City's zeal and affection for king and
government.<a name="FNanchor_161" id="FNanchor_161"></a><a href="#Footnote_161" class="fnanchor">[161]</a> The king commissioned Pitt to thank
the City on his behalf, and to express the satisfaction
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>he felt at this signal proof of the City's resolution to
support the war.<a name="FNanchor_162" id="FNanchor_162"></a><a href="#Footnote_162" class="fnanchor">[162]</a> The money raised between August,
1759 and June 1760, amounted to a little over
&pound;7,000, which was distributed in bounties to 1,235 men,
enlisted for the term of the war with France, at five
guineas a head. The livery companies subscribed to
the fund: the Grocers' contributing 500 guineas, the
Goldsmiths' and the Fishmongers' respectively &pound;500,
the Clothworkers' &pound;300, and other companies lesser
sums. The names of Pitt himself and of Legge also
appear as having each subscribed &pound;100.<a name="FNanchor_163" id="FNanchor_163"></a><a href="#Footnote_163" class="fnanchor">[163]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">City address

<p>But of all the achievements abroad at this time
none caused so much joy as the capture of Quebec
(Sept., 1759). The City once more embraced the
opportunity of presenting a congratulatory address to
the king, at the same time expressing deep regret
at the loss of so gallant an officer as Wolfe.<a name="FNanchor_164" id="FNanchor_164"></a><a href="#Footnote_164" class="fnanchor">[164]</a> A year

preservation of that valuable acquisition, and "to
prosecute the various and extensive services" of the
just and necessary war. Pitt was delighted with the
address. "The address of the city of London," he
wrote to Grenville, "will speak for itself, and I believe
you will think that it speaks loud enough to be heard
at Paris.... How it was heard at Kensington
you need not be told, as the address is big with <i>a
million in every line</i>. Were it able to produce an
advantageous peace it would be most happy; next
to that, such generous and warm assurances of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>supporting the war cannot but give the highest

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXXVII" id="CHAPTER_XXXVII">CHAPTER XXXVII.</a></h2>


<div class="sidenote">The accession
of George III,
1760.</div>

<p>On the 26th October George III was proclaimed
king in the city in the presence of the mayor and
aldermen.<a name="FNanchor_168" id="FNanchor_168"></a><a href="#Footnote_168" class="fnanchor">[168]</a> The usual addresses were presented by
the Courts of Aldermen and Common Council, special
reference being made by the latter body to the
"bloody and expensive war" in which the country
was then engaged. They expressed a hope that the
new king would continue to carry on the war as
prudently and successfully as it had been carried on
hitherto, until an end should be put to it by a firm
and honourable peace. The king in reply echoed
this wish of the citizens, and promised to look after
their "liberties, commerce and happiness."<a name="FNanchor_169" id="FNanchor_169"></a><a href="#Footnote_169" class="fnanchor">[169]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">The fall of
Pitt, 1761.</div>

<p>George had not long been seated on the throne
before he began to display unmistakable signs of a
determination to follow the precepts instilled into his
young mind by his mother, the Princess of Wales,
and to "be a king" in fact as well as in name. The
six months that elapsed before Parliament was dissolved<a name="FNanchor_170" id="FNanchor_170"></a><a href="#Footnote_170" class="fnanchor">[170]</a>
were marked with no great changes, although
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>indications were not wanting of what was likely to
take place. With the dissolution (20 March, 1761),
however, important changes were made in the ministry,
and it became clear that the king was resolved to rule
by ministers of his own choosing. Bute, the particular
friend and adviser of the Princess of Wales,
was appointed one of the secretaries of state. His
admission into the ministry could not mean otherwise
than sooner or later the dismissal of Pitt, for on the
great question of the day&mdash;the war with France&mdash;they
were in direct antagonism; and so it turned
out. Pitt would gladly have made peace<a name="FNanchor_171" id="FNanchor_171"></a><a href="#Footnote_171" class="fnanchor">[171]</a> had not
the honour of the country demanded a declaration of
war with Spain as well as with France owing to a
secret clause in the Family Compact which had come
to his knowledge. The ministry refused to declare
war, and in the following October Pitt and his brother-in-law,
Earl Temple, resigned. In consideration of his
great services a peerage in her own right was conferred
on Pitt's wife, whilst a pension of &pound;3,000 a year, for
three lives, was bestowed on himself.</p>

<div class="sidenote">His letter to
Alderman
Beckford,
15 Oct., 1761.</div>

<p>Pitt's resignation, and more especially his acceptance
of a pension, gave rise to so many slanderous
rumours and brought upon him so much obloquy that
he found it necessary to write to his friend, alderman
Beckford, explaining the exact position of affairs:<a name="FNanchor_172" id="FNanchor_172"></a><a href="#Footnote_172" class="fnanchor">[172]</a>
"A difference of opinion with regard to measures to be
taken against Spain, of the highest importance to
the honour of the crown, and to the most essential
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>national interests, and this founded on what Spain
had already done, not on what that court may further
intend to do, was the cause of my resigning the
seals. Lord Temple and I submitted in writing,
and signed by us, our most humble sentiments to
his majesty; which being over-ruled by the united
opinion of all the rest of the king's servants I
resigned the seals on Monday, the 5th of the month
(October), in order not to remain responsible for
measures which I was no longer allowed to guide."
In the same dignified strain he tells his friend of the
honours bestowed on him by his sovereign, the
acceptance of which had set malicious tongues
wagging. "Most gracious marks of his majesty's
approbation of my services followed my resignation.
They are unmerited and unsolicited; and I shall
ever be proud to have received them from the best
of sovereigns."</p>

<div class="sidenote">The City's vote
of thanks to
Pitt, 22 Oct.,
1761.</div>

<p>The letter was written on the 15th October
(1761), and a few days later (22 Oct.) the Common
Council passed a vote of thanks to Pitt by a large
majority&mdash;109 votes to 15&mdash;acknowledging his many
great and eminent services, and testifying the City's
gratitude not only for having roused "the ancient
spirit" of the nation from the pusillanimous state
into which it had fallen, but also for his having greatly
extended the sphere of trade and commerce. In
conclusion the Court expressed its sorrow at "the
national loss of so able, so faithful a minister at
this critical conjuncture."<a name="FNanchor_173" id="FNanchor_173"></a><a href="#Footnote_173" class="fnanchor">[173]</a> Pitt was highly gratified
at this recognition of his services, and in his acknowledgment
of the vote paid the following tribute to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
City's loyalty and zeal:&mdash;"It will ever be remembered
to the glory of the city of London that through
the whole course of this arduous war that great
seat of commerce has generously set the illustrious
example of steady zeal for the dignity of the crown
and of unshaken firmness and magnanimity."<a name="FNanchor_174" id="FNanchor_174"></a><a href="#Footnote_174" class="fnanchor">[174]</a>
This was no mean praise coming from such a man.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The king and
queen at the
Guildhall,
9 Nov., 1761.</div>

<p>On lord mayor's day the king (following the
usual custom of the sovereign attending the first lord
mayor's banquet after his accession) came into the
city and was entertained at the Guildhall, together
with the queen. Pitt also was a guest. He and Temple
drove down together in a carriage and pair, and were
received with even greater acclamation than the king
himself. The entertainment was given in the most

by a violent display of party feeling. Whilst Pitt was
received everywhere with cheers and clapping of
hands, his rival, Bute, was hooted and pelted, and
would, it was thought, have come off still worse had
he not taken the precaution of surrounding his carriage
with a strong body of "butchers and bruisers."
Beckford was believed to have been at the bottom
of the mischief. It was by his directions that the
Guildhall was packed with Pitt's supporters, and he
led the <i>claque</i> on the arrival of the ex-minister.<a name="FNanchor_176" id="FNanchor_176"></a><a href="#Footnote_176" class="fnanchor">[176]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span></p>

<p>Pitt, on the other hand, was blamed for lending
himself to such an ostentatious display, which could
not appear otherwise than disrespectful to the king.
Indeed he afterwards owned that he had done wrong.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Instructions to
City members,
22 Oct., 1761.</div>

<p>The events which immediately followed Pitt's
resignation enhanced his reputation for political
foresight, and Bute, who became prime minister,
found himself compelled, as indeed Pitt had predicted,
to declare war against Spain (Jan., 1762).
Until this was done the City was determined to leave
him no peace. The Common Council, as was its
wont, drew up instructions for the city members as
to the policy they were to pursue in the coming
parliament.<a name="FNanchor_178" id="FNanchor_178"></a><a href="#Footnote_178" class="fnanchor">[178]</a> They were in the first place to use their
best endeavours to obtain the repeal of a recent Act
for the relief of insolvent debtors, and in the next to
keep a sharp eye on "the distribution of the national
treasure," but above all they were to oppose any
attempt made by government to give up recently
acquired possessions, more especially in North
America, and they were to vote any supplies that
might be necessary for carrying on the war with
vigour. The "present happy extinction of parties,"
the nation's zeal and affection for their "native king,"
and the increase of commerce were proofs (the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>Council declared) of the ability of the country to
carry on the war. Finally the city members were to
vote such supplies as were necessary to place the
king above the menaces of foreign interference, whilst
supporting such measures as would conduce to a safe
and honourable peace.<a name="FNanchor_179" id="FNanchor_179"></a><a href="#Footnote_179" class="fnanchor">[179]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">John Wilkes,
M.P. for
Aylesbury,
1761.</div>

<p>The new ministry soon found themselves in direct
opposition not only to the city members but to one
who was destined ere long to prove a veritable thorn
in their side. John Wilkes, a man of shamelessly
immoral character, but of undeniable talent, had for
the second time been returned for Aylesbury. His
expensive debaucheries had reduced him to the direst
possible straits, and he had taken to a political career
as a possible means of getting himself out of his
pecuniary difficulties. He had at the outset declared
himself a staunch supporter of Pitt, and to Pitt he had
more than once looked for some crumb of patronage
to alleviate his distress. As soon as Parliament met
Wilkes seized the opportunity of the debate on the
address to pass some censures on the king's speech,
or rather the speech of the king's minister, although
he affected to be ignorant as to which minister he
ought to attribute it. He declared that although
the country was nominally at peace with Spain it
was in reality in a state of war, and that the nation
was being kept in the dark by the ministers, who
refused all information. Beckford joined in the debate,
urging the right of the country to "demand
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>peace, sword in hand," and offering to second Wilkes
in moving for the Spanish papers.<a name="FNanchor_180" id="FNanchor_180"></a><a href="#Footnote_180" class="fnanchor">[180]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Declaration

<p>In January (1762) war was declared, and all the
papers relative to the rupture with Spain were laid
before Parliament. No sooner was this done than
Wilkes wrote a pamphlet entitled "Observations on
the Papers relative to the Rupture with Spain," in
which he vindicated the policy of Pitt and exposed
the folly of the existing ministry in having let slip the
best opportunity that ever offered of crushing Spain
beyond recovery. This was his first political essay,
and at once stamped Wilkes as a political as well as
literary writer of no mean order.<a name="FNanchor_181" id="FNanchor_181"></a><a href="#Footnote_181" class="fnanchor">[181]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">City address

<p>The success of the war exceeded expectation.
One expedition reduced Cuba, another Manila, whilst
Spanish commerce was swept from the sea. The
surrender of the island of St. Lucia and the capture
of Martinico drew forth a congratulatory address to
the king from the City, and once more the citizens
were assured of his majesty's desire to promote their
commercial interests.<a name="FNanchor_182" id="FNanchor_182"></a><a href="#Footnote_182" class="fnanchor">[182]</a> The credit of the war was due
to Pitt for having foreseen the struggle, and for the
preparations he had made accordingly.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Peace of

<p>All this time the thoughts of Bute were fixedly
directed towards peace, and on the 10th February,

to the Seven Years' War.<a name="FNanchor_183" id="FNanchor_183"></a><a href="#Footnote_183" class="fnanchor">[183]</a> The peace was distasteful
to the City as well as to the nation at large. The
Court of Aldermen, it is true, congratulated the king on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>having "happily concluded a very just and expensive
war by a necessary and advantageous peace,"<a name="FNanchor_184" id="FNanchor_184"></a><a href="#Footnote_184" class="fnanchor">[184]</a> but
the Common Council said nothing. When the peace
came to be debated in the House of Commons it met
with strong opposition from Pitt, who spoke against
it for more than three hours, although he was at
the time so ill that he had to be carried down to
the House. By practising a wholesale system of
bribery the government managed, nevertheless, to
obtain so large a majority that the Princess of Wales
exclaimed in great exultation "Now my son is really
king."</p>

<div class="sidenote">Resignation
of Bute,
8 April, 1763.</div>

<p>The triumph of the king and his favourite were
destined to be short-lived. An important feature of
the budget for the year was a proposal to impose a
tax upon cider. The proposal at once met with the
most determined opposition, not only from the cider
counties but also from the city of London, where
anything in the nature of excise was looked upon
with horror. The Common Council raised a strong
protest against any such extension of excise duties at a
time when there was every prospect of a continuation
of peace.<a name="FNanchor_185" id="FNanchor_185"></a><a href="#Footnote_185" class="fnanchor">[185]</a> The Bill eventually passed, but the unpopularity
of Bute increased to such an extent that he
got sick of office and retired (8 April).</p>

<div class="sidenote">Wilkes and the

<p>A few days later (23 April) Parliament was
prorogued, the king in his speech alluding to the late
peace as alike honourable to the crown and beneficial
to the people.<a name="FNanchor_186" id="FNanchor_186"></a><a href="#Footnote_186" class="fnanchor">[186]</a> This gave occasion to Wilkes to
make a violent attack in the next number of his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>paper, called, in allusion to Bute, the <i>North Briton</i>.
Fourty-four numbers had appeared at the time of
Bute's resignation, and although each number had
contained matter more or less libellous no notice had
been taken of them. No. 45 was destined to become
famous, for although it was not a whit worse than
any of its predecessors its prosecution was immediately
ordered by Grenville, who had succeeded to the head
of affairs. On the last day of April Wilkes was
arrested on a general warrant (<i>i.e.</i>, a warrant in which
no individual is specified by name) and lodged in the
Tower, whilst his house was ransacked and papers
seized. These harsh and illegal proceedings excited
popular feeling and raised Wilkes to the rank of a
political martyr. Crowds flocked daily to visit him
in his confinement, among them being the leaders of
the opposition, Temple and Grafton. Early in May
his arrest was pronounced illegal by Pratt, Chief Justice
of the Common Pleas, and he was discharged.</p>

<div class="sidenote">No. 45 of

<p>As soon as Parliament met, which was not until
November (1763), Wilkes complained of the breach
of privilege in the seizure of himself and his papers.
He got no sympathy, however, in that quarter,
although he shortly afterwards succeeded in obtaining
damages to the extent of &pound;1,000 against the
under-secretary of state in a court of law.<a name="FNanchor_187" id="FNanchor_187"></a><a href="#Footnote_187" class="fnanchor">[187]</a> So far
from sympathising with Wilkes the House ordered
No. 45 of the <i>North Briton</i> to be burnt by the
common hangman at the Royal Exchange as a false,
scandalous, and malicious libel.<a name="FNanchor_188" id="FNanchor_188"></a><a href="#Footnote_188" class="fnanchor">[188]</a> Saturday, the 3rd
December, was the day appointed for carrying out
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>the order, but when the sheriffs attended for the
purpose and the executioner began to perform his
duty a riot ensued, the magistrates were mobbed, and
the paper rescued from the flames. The Lords thereupon
summoned the sheriffs to give an account of
their conduct. One of the sheriffs, Thomas Harley, a
brother of the Earl of Oxford, being a member of the
House of Commons, the permission of that House
had to be asked before his attendance could be
enforced. It was left to Harley to do as he liked;
he might attend the Lords "if he thought fit."<a name="FNanchor_189" id="FNanchor_189"></a><a href="#Footnote_189" class="fnanchor">[189]</a>
Harley did think fit, and on the Tuesday following
(6 Dec.) attended with his brother sheriff and Osmond
Cooke, the city marshal. Being called upon to give
an account of what had taken place the previous
Saturday, Harley informed the House to the following
effect, viz.: that the sheriffs had met at the Guildhall
at half-past twelve o'clock, and thence proceeded to
Cornhill to carry out the order of Parliament; they
there met the city marshal, who expressed a fear that
the order could not be carried out without military
assistance; that, nevertheless, he was determined, in
spite of all opposition, to carry out the order if possible;
that he tried to get to the place in his chariot, but
could not, and so went on foot; that on arrival at the
place where the fuel was prepared he found the wood
so wet that it could not take fire, "but he read the
order, and gave the paper with his own hands into
the hands of the executioner, who held it on the
lighted torch, which he held in his hand, till it was
burnt, and that he saw it burnt pursuant to the
order." On his return&mdash;he went on to say&mdash;the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
window of his carriage was broken, and he had to take
refuge in the Mansion House,<a name="FNanchor_190" id="FNanchor_190"></a><a href="#Footnote_190" class="fnanchor">[190]</a> where he found the
mayor (William Bridgen, who had recently succeeded
Beckford) doing business as usual.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The mayor's

<p>That the mayor should have shown such sympathy
with the mob as not to lend assistance to the sheriffs
in putting down the disturbance roused the anger of
the Duke of Bedford, who broke forth against Bridgen
and the City. "Such behaviour," he said, "in any
smaller town would have forfeited their franchises.
The Common Council had long been setting themselves
up against the Parliament, and last year had
taken on them to advise the king to refuse his assent
to a law that had passed through both Houses. He

<p>Harley's statement having been corroborated by

sheriffs.<a name="FNanchor_192" id="FNanchor_192"></a><a href="#Footnote_192" class="fnanchor">[192]</a> It was otherwise with the Common Council.
They upheld the conduct of the mayor and condemned

before the House of Lords a copy of an obscene
parody on Pope's <i>Essay on Man</i>, which Wilkes had
written for the delectation of his intimate friends, but
never intended to publish. With much difficulty, and
not without some treachery, Sandwich had managed
to obtain a copy of this infamous production, and he
was now base enough to produce it in evidence
against his recent boon companion, and to demand
his punishment. The House condemned the poem as
a blasphemous libel, but the treachery and hypocrisy
displayed by Sandwich, whose own vices were
notorious, raised a storm of public indignation, and
when the <i>Beggar's Opera</i> was shortly afterwards
being performed at Covent Garden, and Macheath
exclaimed, in the words put into his mouth by Gay,
"<i>That Jemmy Twitcher should peach me, I own

shortly afterwards made to Parliament for pecuniary
assistance to help the City to discharge the debt on
Blackfriars Bridge&mdash;a debt which had been augmented

<div class="sidenote">Chatham and

<p>Having quarrelled in turn with Grenville and

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>July, 1766, to resort again to the "Great Commoner"
whom he created Earl of Chatham and made Prime
Minister with the office of Lord Privy Seal. His
acceptance of a peerage produced a general burst of
indignation. According to Horace Walpole&mdash;who
never misses an opportunity of girding at the City
in return for its treatment of his father&mdash;"the city
and the mob" (convertible terms in his estimation),
were angry, because in his new position, Pitt would
have less opportunity of "doing jobs" for them than
when he was in the House of Commons.<a name="FNanchor_199" id="FNanchor_199"></a><a href="#Footnote_199" class="fnanchor">[199]</a> But
however this may be, the state of the Prime Minister's
health had before the end of the year rendered him
incapable of "doing jobs" for the City or anybody
else, and he left the control of affairs in the hands of
the Duke of Grafton and Charles Townshend. Before
withdrawing, however, he intimated his intention to
the House of bringing in a bill for regulating the
East India Company's affairs. Strange to say, the
City failed to grasp the full portent of such a bill, or to
see any danger to themselves in this meditated attack
upon the chartered rights of others. Later on, when
Fox introduced his East India Bill, the City was
wider awake. The motion for carrying out Chatham's
plan was not only made by a city alderman, viz.,
Beckford,<a name="FNanchor_200" id="FNanchor_200"></a><a href="#Footnote_200" class="fnanchor">[200]</a> but the Common Council offered (June,
1767) Townshend, a supporter of the motion, the
Freedom of the City, in recognition of "his well-tempered
zeal in support of the undoubted legislative

Grafton asking for his mediation. The minister
coldly referred him to Chatham, a proceeding which
so galled Wilkes that he hurried back to the continent
for fear of being laid by the heels, and a year later
published what purported to be a second letter to the
Duke of Grafton expressing the greatest disappointment
at his Grace's answer, and inveighing in the
strongest possible terms against Chatham as being an

offer himself a candidate for the City. Every day he
appeared on the hustings, and displayed great activity
in canvassing for votes, but it was of no avail.</p>

<p>Not in the least dismayed, this irrepressible
demagogue rallied his forces and declared himself a
candidate for the county of Middlesex. There he
was more successful. The election was very riotous;
the streets and highways leading to Brentford were
in the hands of the mob, who would allow no one to
pass without a blue cockade in his hat inscribed with
the name of Wilkes, and the number 45. "It was not
safe to pass through Piccadilly; and every family
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>was forced to put out lights; the windows of unilluminated
houses were demolished. The coach
glasses of such as did not huzza for <i>Wilkes</i> and
<i>liberty</i> were broken, and many chariots and coaches
were spoiled by the mob scratching them with the
favourite 45." This was the description of the scene
by an eye-witness. In the city matters were no better.
The windows of the Mansion House were smashed,
Harley, the mayor, being known to be no favourite
of Wilkes. The trained bands were called out, but
proved insufficient to cope with the multitude, but at
length peace was restored with the aid of a military
force from the Tower.<a name="FNanchor_203" id="FNanchor_203"></a><a href="#Footnote_203" class="fnanchor">[203]</a> The result of the poll was

neglect of duty. At length he was taken into custody
and committed to the King's Bench prison (27 April).
When he left the Court the mob stopt his coach on
Westminster Bridge, took out the horses, and themselves
drew him as far as Cornhill. They insisted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>

itself in the Cabinet as to whether or not Wilkes

<div class="sidenote">Wilkes elected
alderman,
Jan., 1769.</div>

<p>Notwithstanding his imprisonment Wilkes was
as irrepressible as ever, and he nearly succeeded in
setting both Houses by the ears over the hard usage
he had received. His colleague in the representation
of Middlesex having died, he nominated his friend and
counsel, Glynn, for the vacant seat, and got him in.
Early in the following year (1769) he contrived to get
himself returned alderman of the Ward of Farringdon
Without, the rival candidate being forced to retire
from the poll for fear of raising disturbances in the
ward&mdash;"even the constables in the city were almost
to a man devoted to Wilkes."<a name="FNanchor_209" id="FNanchor_209"></a><a href="#Footnote_209" class="fnanchor">[209]</a> The Court of
Aldermen, however, refused to admit him, and ordered
another election.<a name="FNanchor_210" id="FNanchor_210"></a><a href="#Footnote_210" class="fnanchor">[210]</a> This time he was returned unopposed.
Still the Court hesitated to admit him until
they had been furnished with copies of the proceedings
against him in the King's Bench, and at length
resolved to take the opinion of counsel upon the
following questions, viz.: (1) whether the election
of Wilkes was a valid election; (2) whether he was
entitled by law to be admitted by the court by
virtue or in pursuance of that election.<a name="FNanchor_211" id="FNanchor_211"></a><a href="#Footnote_211" class="fnanchor">[211]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Opinions of
counsel.</div>

<p>The case as settled by the Court of Aldermen
and submitted to counsel is set out <i>in extenso</i> in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>the minutes of the court held on the 25th April,<a name="FNanchor_212" id="FNanchor_212"></a><a href="#Footnote_212" class="fnanchor">[212]</a>
when the opinions of the several counsel were read.
The attorney and solicitor general as well as Yorke,
Glynn, and Leigh gave it as their opinion, that the
judgments pronounced against Wilkes did not render
him by law incapable of being elected an alderman of
the city, and that he might be admitted into office,
but they expressed a doubt whether the Court of
Aldermen could be forced to admit him. On the
other hand, the Recorder and the Common Sergeant
as well as Fletcher Norton (who gave a separate
opinion) declared Wilkes's election, in their opinion,
to be invalid. Had it been valid, the Recorder and
Common Sergeant believed there was no other
objection to his being admitted except the impossibility
of his attending the Court of Aldermen
for the purpose; but Norton was of opinion that
the crimes of which Wilkes had been convicted were
a sufficient justification for the court to refuse to
admit him, over and above his incapacity at the
present time to attend to the duties of the office.<a name="FNanchor_213" id="FNanchor_213"></a><a href="#Footnote_213" class="fnanchor">[213]</a>
Under the circumstances it was deemed best to keep
the aldermanry open until Wilkes regained his liberty.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Wilkes again

<p>In the meanwhile Wilkes had appealed to both
Houses against the sentence passed on him. He
demanded to be heard at the Bar of the House of
Lords in defence of his writings, but this was denied
him, and the writs of error which he had brought
were argued by his counsel, Glynn and Davenport.
This was on the 16th January (1769). On the 27th,
the day that he was returned unopposed as Alderman
of the ward of Farringdon Without, he was brought
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>before the Commons, but nothing urged either by
himself or his counsel could move them in his favour

<p>No sooner had the House passed this resolution
than Wilkes announced his intention of again standing
for Middlesex, and on the 16th February, he was
again returned without any opposition. On this
occasion he was proposed by two members of parliament
who were shortly to become his brother
aldermen, viz., Townshend and Sawbridge. Again
the House declared his election void, and himself
to be incapable of sitting in the existing parliament.<a name="FNanchor_215" id="FNanchor_215"></a><a href="#Footnote_215" class="fnanchor">[215]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Returned the

<p>Not a whit abashed Wilkes again offered himself
as a candidate, his only opponent being Charles
Dingley. Upon the day of the election (16 March),
Dingley, who had on a previous occasion come to
blows with Reynolds, Wilkes's election agent, and
had come off second best, received such rough
handling that he was obliged to retire and leave the
field to Wilkes, who was returned unopposed. The
election was for the third time declared void, and a

<div class="sidenote">Returned the

12 April, 1769</div>

<p>The struggle began to be very serious. Whilst
loyal addresses poured in from various parts of the
country, the City held aloof, and the conduct of
Samuel Turner, the lord mayor, who was a zealous
Wilkite received a distinct mark of approval from the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>Common Council.<a name="FNanchor_217" id="FNanchor_217"></a><a href="#Footnote_217" class="fnanchor">[217]</a> In the meantime a number of rich
and influential men&mdash;among whom were Horne the
vicar of Brentford, who loved to mix himself up in
political and municipal matters, Townshend, Sawbridge,
Oliver and others&mdash;had formed themselves
into a society for the purpose of helping Wilkes to
pay his fines and other liabilities and of supporting
him and his cause. The society came to be known
as the Supporters of the Bill of Rights.<a name="FNanchor_218" id="FNanchor_218"></a><a href="#Footnote_218" class="fnanchor">[218]</a> The
freeholders of Middlesex met at Mile End, and
unanimously resolved in spite of all opposition to
stand by the representative of their choice; whilst
a procession of merchants and tradesmen on their
way to St. James's with a loyal address was roughly
treated by the mob and broken up.<a name="FNanchor_219" id="FNanchor_219"></a><a href="#Footnote_219" class="fnanchor">[219]</a> It required a
man of some courage to oppose Wilkes at the
forthcoming election, and he was found in Colonel
Luttrell, an Irishman, whose father was a devoted
adherent of Lord Bute. So desperate, however,
did Luttrell's case appear that his life was specially
insured for the occasion.<a name="FNanchor_220" id="FNanchor_220"></a><a href="#Footnote_220" class="fnanchor">[220]</a> Two other candidates
stood, but the election really lay between Wilkes and
Luttrell, the first being nominated by Townshend,
and the latter by Stephen Fox, Lord Holland's son.
The polling took place on the 12th April, when
Wilkes was for the fourth time returned by an overwhelming
majority. A huge crowd immediately
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>made its way to the King's Bench Prison with
colours flying and bands playing, to congratulate him
upon his success. When the result of the election
was reported to the House, they not only rejected
Wilkes, but declared Luttrell to be elected, and ordered
the return to be amended accordingly.<a name="FNanchor_221" id="FNanchor_221"></a><a href="#Footnote_221" class="fnanchor">[221]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Remonstrance
of the livery,
24 June, 1769.</div>

<p>Such a proceeding on the part of parliament
raised a grave constitutional question, and caused
great commotion in the city. If it lay with parliament
of its own mere motion, and without the authority of
an Act, to deprive electors of their right of choosing
their own representatives, the livery of London
would suffer with the rest of the kingdom. The
matter was warmly taken up by <i>Junius</i>, who strenuously
condemned this usurpation by parliament.<a name="FNanchor_222" id="FNanchor_222"></a><a href="#Footnote_222" class="fnanchor">[222]</a>
The mayor was asked to summon a Common Hall
"for the purpose of taking the sense of the livery of
London on the measures proper to be pursued by
them in the present alarming situation of public
affairs." Turner declined to act in the matter on
his own responsibility, and referred the petition to
the Common Council who told him not to accede
to the request (5 May).<a name="FNanchor_223" id="FNanchor_223"></a><a href="#Footnote_223" class="fnanchor">[223]</a> Thus thrown on their
own resources the livery resolved at their ordinary
meeting on the following Midsummer Day when
Townshend and Sawbridge were chosen sheriffs, to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>petition the king himself against the arbitrary action
of the government. A petition to this effect had
been drawn up by some of the livery previous to
the meeting of the Common Hall. It purported to
come from "the lord mayor, commonalty and livery
of the city of London," but upon the lord mayor
objecting to this, the title was changed to "the
humble petition of the livery of the city of London
in Common Hall assembled." The petitioners did
not mince words. The king's ministers were charged
with peculation, and with illegally issuing general
warrants. They had violently seized persons and
papers, and after defeating and insulting the law on
various occasions, had wrested from the people, the
last sacred right they had left, viz., "the right of
election, by the unprecedented seating a candidate
notoriously set up and chosen by themselves."
Deprived of all hope of parliamentary redress, the
petitioners turned to the king, reminding him that it
was for the purpose of redress alone, and for such
occasions as the present, that so great and extensive
powers had been entrusted to the crown.<a name="FNanchor_224" id="FNanchor_224"></a><a href="#Footnote_224" class="fnanchor">[224]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Lord
Holland's
letter to the
mayor,
9 July, 1769.</div>

<p>Among the ministers whom the livery charged
with peculation was Lord Holland, to whom they
had made special reference (although not actually
mentioning his name) as "a public defaulter of unaccounted
millions." Stung to the quick at this
imputation, Lord Holland wrote a letter to the lord
mayor (9 July), complaining of the aspersion and
referring him for the falsehood of the accusation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
to Beckford, whom he had satisfied (he said) as to
the injustice of it.<a name="FNanchor_225" id="FNanchor_225"></a><a href="#Footnote_225" class="fnanchor">[225]</a> Turner contented himself with a
curt reply that he was not answerable for the contents
of the petition. There was no love lost between
Lord Holland and the citizens. According to the
words put into his mouth by Gray, the poet, he would
gladly have seen it reduced by fire and sword:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">

<div class="sidenote">Beckford

<p>The address had been ordered to be presented by
the lord mayor, the sheriffs, and three of the city's
members, but months passed by and no reply was
vouchsafed. The livery got impatient. Their attack
on the ministry was strengthened by the re-appearance
of Chatham,<a name="FNanchor_226" id="FNanchor_226"></a><a href="#Footnote_226" class="fnanchor">[226]</a> after a prolonged illness, whilst their own
position received material support by Beckford consenting
for the second time to occupy the mayoralty
chair. "I cannot resist the importunate request of my
fellow citizens"&mdash;he wrote from his house in Soho
Square, the 12th October,<a name="FNanchor_227" id="FNanchor_227"></a><a href="#Footnote_227" class="fnanchor">[227]</a>&mdash;"their desires have overcome
resolutions that I once thought were fixed and
determined. The feeble efforts of a worn out
man to serve them can never answer their sanguine
expectations. I will do my best, and will sacrifice
ease and retirement, the chief comfort of old age,
to their wishes. I <i>do</i> accept the office of lord

Lordship and my brethren the Court of Aldermen.
The advantage and good effects of their advice
were experienced on many occasions in my late

more strengthened, had similar petitions been sent

example was not in this case followed.<a name="FNanchor_228" id="FNanchor_228"></a><a href="#Footnote_228" class="fnanchor">[228]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Resolutions
of the livery,
10 Oct., 1769.</div>

<p>On the day that the result of the poll was
declared (10 Oct.) in favour of Beckford as mayor for
the ensuing year the livery passed several resolutions.
The first was that the outgoing lord mayor (Turner)
should be asked if he had received any answer to
the recent petition. Secondly that he should be
called upon to produce Lord Holland's letter. They
in the next place publicly named Lord Holland as
the paymaster to whom they had referred in their
petition as "a public defaulter of unaccounted
millions," and insisted upon a parliamentary enquiry
into his accounts. Should he be found such a
defaulter as they alleged, it was the duty of the
city's representatives in Parliament to move for his
impeachment. These resolutions they ordered to be
placed on record, as part of the proceedings in relation
to the election of a mayor, and a copy of them was
to be sent to each of the city's members.<a name="FNanchor_229" id="FNanchor_229"></a><a href="#Footnote_229" class="fnanchor">[229]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Another
address of
the livery,
6 March,
1770.</div>

<p>Here matters were allowed to rest until the
following March (1770), when the livery sought the
assistance of the Common Council to get Beckford to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>summon a Common Hall for the purpose of taking
further measures to secure their rights and privileges.<a name="FNanchor_230" id="FNanchor_230"></a><a href="#Footnote_230" class="fnanchor">[230]</a>
Why they did not make a direct application to the
mayor himself, as was the usual practice, is not clear.
The Court, after some hesitation, acceded to their
request, and a Common Hall was summoned accordingly.
Another address, remonstrance and petition
was thereupon drawn up (6 March).<a name="FNanchor_231" id="FNanchor_231"></a><a href="#Footnote_231" class="fnanchor">[231]</a> "A bolder
declaration, both against king and Parliament"&mdash;Walpole
writes to his friend<a name="FNanchor_232" id="FNanchor_232"></a><a href="#Footnote_232" class="fnanchor">[232]</a>&mdash;was never seen. The
majority of the Court of Aldermen would have formally
disavowed it, but Beckford, who presided, refused to
allow a motion to that effect to be moved until the
City's Records had been searched with the view of
determining the several powers of the Courts of
Aldermen and Common Council, and of the livery in
Common Hall assembled.<a name="FNanchor_233" id="FNanchor_233"></a><a href="#Footnote_233" class="fnanchor">[233]</a> After referring to their
former petition remaining still unanswered, the
petitioners proceeded to inveigh against Parliament
and the ministry for having deprived the people
of their just rights. The majority in the House
(they said) had "done a deed more ruinous in its
consequences than the levying of ship-money by
Charles the First or the dispensing power assumed
by James the Second." They told the king to his
face that the House of Commons as then constituted
did not only fail to represent the people, but it was
"corruptly subservient" to his own ministers, and they
called upon his majesty on that account to dissolve
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>the Parliament and dismiss those ministers who had
advised him badly.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The remonstrance
approved by
<i>Junius</i>.</div>

<p>This language was bold, but it conveyed no more
than the truth. Its truthfulness, no less than its boldness,
attracted <i>Junius</i>, who thus wrote approvingly of
the attitude taken up by London: "The city of London
hath given an example which, I doubt not, will be
followed by the whole kingdom. The noble spirit of
the metropolis is the life-blood of the state, collected
at the heart; from that point it circulates, with health
and vigour, through every artery of the constitution.... The
city of London have expressed their
sentiments with freedom and firmness; they have
spoken truth boldly; and in whatever light their
remonstrance may be represented by courtiers, I
defy the most subtle lawyer in this country to point
out a single instance in which they have exceeded
the truth. Even that assertion, which we are told
is most offensive to Parliament, in the theory of the
English constitution is strictly true. If any part of
the representative body be not chosen by the people
that part vitiates the whole."<a name="FNanchor_234" id="FNanchor_234"></a><a href="#Footnote_234" class="fnanchor">[234]</a> Adopting the words
of the remonstrance, he declared that the principle on
which the Middlesex election had been determined
was more pernicious in its effects than either the
levying of ship-money by Charles I or the suspending
power claimed by his son.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Condemned
by Goldsmiths,
Weavers and
Grocers.</div>

<p>On the other hand several of the livery companies
themselves, viz.: the Goldsmiths, the Weavers, and
the Grocers, had declared the remonstrance to be
indecent and disrespectful, and forbade the members<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
of their respective liveries to attend any Common
Hall in future (except for purposes of election)
without express leave of their Courts of Assistants.
The authority of the mayor and aldermen over
the livery companies was thus openly defied. On
learning of these resolutions Beckford summoned a
Common Hall to meet on the 12th April to consider
what course to take, but his precept was ignored
by the recalcitrant companies. Such disobedience
was hitherto unheard of, and the matter was reported
to the livery committee, appointed the 28th September,
1769.<a name="FNanchor_235" id="FNanchor_235"></a><a href="#Footnote_235" class="fnanchor">[235]</a> This committee was afterwards
united with a committee of the Common Council,
and after due consideration the question of the rights
of the livery was submitted to counsel.<a name="FNanchor_236" id="FNanchor_236"></a><a href="#Footnote_236" class="fnanchor">[236]</a> The result
will be seen in the next chapter.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The king
hesitates to
receive the
address.</div>

<p>Unlike the former address, this was invested with
a corporate character by being ordered to be presented
by the lord mayor, the city members, the Court of
Aldermen, the sheriffs and the Common Council. In
due course the sheriffs attended (6 March), to learn
when the king would be pleased to receive the
address. They were told they had come at an
improper time, and must deliver their message on a
court day. By treating them in this manner the
king hoped to hear no more of the matter; it was&mdash;he
told Lord Weymouth&mdash;the most likely means of
putting an end to "this stuff." He desired, however,
that the opinion of Lord Mansfield should be taken
as to whether the sheriffs could claim to be received
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>"as on occasions that they addressed the crown."<a name="FNanchor_237" id="FNanchor_237"></a><a href="#Footnote_237" class="fnanchor">[237]</a>
On the following day the sheriffs again presented
themselves. After the lev&eacute;e was over they were
admitted to the closet, but not before some questions
had been asked as to the nature of the address to
be presented. Sheriff Townshend having made his
formal request the king replied that as the case was
"entirely new" he would take time to consider it,
and would send an answer by one of his principal
secretaries of state. The question to be decided was
whether the address ought to be treated as coming
from the citizens of London in their corporate capacity
or as only proceeding from a comparatively small body
of them, viz., the livery. If the former, it would, in
accordance with custom, be received by the king on
the throne; if the latter, the king would receive it at
a lev&eacute;e or in any other manner he might think fit.
In order, therefore, to discover the precise nature of
the address the king directed Lord Weymouth to
make the necessary enquiries. Lord Weymouth
accordingly wrote (8 March) to the sheriffs asking
in what manner the address was authenticated and
what was the nature of the assembly by which it had
been adopted as it appeared to be "entirely new."<a name="FNanchor_238" id="FNanchor_238"></a><a href="#Footnote_238" class="fnanchor">[238]</a>
Instead of answering the letter the sheriffs the next
day (9 March) again put in an appearance at St.
James's, accompanied by the Remembrancer. Being
asked whether they came "with a fresh message or
with a message?" they answered "with a message."
The secretaries of state then appeared, and Lord
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>Weymouth asked the sheriffs if they had received his
letter, and whether they came in consequence of it or
on any fresh business? They replied that they had
received his letter and had come in consequence of it.
The following dialogue is recorded as having then
taken place:&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Lord Weymouth</i>: "Would it not be more proper
to send an answer in writing through me?"</p>

<p><i>The Sheriffs</i>: "We act ministerially. As sheriffs
of London we have a right to an audience, and cannot
communicate to any other person than the king the
subject of our message."</p>

<p><i>Lord Weymouth</i>: "I do not dispute your right to
an audience, but would it not be better and more
accurate to give your message to me in writing?"</p>

<p><i>The Sheriffs</i>: "We know the value and consequence
of the citizen's right to apply immediately to
the king, and not to a third person, and we do not
mean that any of their rights and privileges should be
betrayed by our means."</p>

<div class="sidenote">Sheriff

<div class="sidenote">The king

the mayor), for obtaining some guarantee of the
future policy of the Opposition whenever they
should come into power, and he and Horne had
devised a plan for getting the guests to sign a
formal document committing them definitely to
certain reforms. Such a document Horne afterwards
declared himself to have actually drawn up
"in terms so cautious and precise as to leave no
room for future quibble and evasion."<a name="FNanchor_246" id="FNanchor_246"></a><a href="#Footnote_246" class="fnanchor">[246]</a> This
device becoming known, Chatham wrote to say that
in the opinion of himself, Lord Rockingham and
Lord Temple, "no new matters should be opened or
agitated at or after the convivium"<a name="FNanchor_247" id="FNanchor_247"></a><a href="#Footnote_247" class="fnanchor">[247]</a> which was
fixed for Thursday, the 22nd March,&mdash;the eve of
the day on which both Houses were to present an
address to the king touching the remonstrance. The
entertainment was one of the most magnificent ever
given by a private individual. The members were
escorted to the city by the livery of London on
horseback through the crowded streets. Those who
failed to illuminate their houses ran the risk of having
their windows broken.<a name="FNanchor_248" id="FNanchor_248"></a><a href="#Footnote_248" class="fnanchor">[248]</a> Chatham was prevented
from attending by an attack of his old enemy the
gout.<a name="FNanchor_249" id="FNanchor_249"></a><a href="#Footnote_249" class="fnanchor">[249]</a> Magnificent as was the entertainment from
a social point of view, from a political it was money
thrown away.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Wilkes regains
his liberty,
17 April,
1770.</div>

<p>Wilkes's term of imprisonment was now fast
drawing to a close. His release was looked forward
to by his friends with great joy, by his enemies
with no little fear and concern. In November last
(1769), his spirits and the spirits of his party had
been raised by a jury awarding him no less a sum
than &pound;4,000 by way of damages in his long protracted
action against Lord Halifax,<a name="FNanchor_250" id="FNanchor_250"></a><a href="#Footnote_250" class="fnanchor">[250]</a> by whose orders his
papers had been seized. Nevertheless his second fine
of &pound;500 remained yet unpaid.<a name="FNanchor_251" id="FNanchor_251"></a><a href="#Footnote_251" class="fnanchor">[251]</a> On the 17th April
(1770) Wilkes regained his liberty, and in order to
prevent disturbance slipped away into the country,
to the house of his friend Reynolds, for a few days.
On his return he was immediately sworn in as
alderman of the ward of Farringdon Without (24
April).<a name="FNanchor_252" id="FNanchor_252"></a><a href="#Footnote_252" class="fnanchor">[252]</a> At the outset of his new career Wilkes
behaved with the greatest propriety. "I don't know
whether Wilkes is subdued by his imprisonment"&mdash;wrote
Walpole to his friend&mdash;"or waits for the rising
of parliament, to take the field; or whether his
dignity of alderman has dulled him into prudence
and the love of feasting; but hitherto he has done
nothing but go to city-banquets and sermons, and
sit at Guildhall as a sober magistrate."<a name="FNanchor_253" id="FNanchor_253"></a><a href="#Footnote_253" class="fnanchor">[253]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">A remonstrance
by
Common
Council,
14 May, 1770.</div>

<p>On the 14th May, he was nominated a member
of the committee appointed by the Common Council
to draw up another humble address, remonstrance
and petition to the king, "touching the violated right
of election, and the applications of the livery of
London, and his majesty's answer thereupon." An
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>address was accordingly drawn up&mdash;"much less
hot than the former"&mdash;calling upon the king to
dissolve parliament and dismiss his ministers.<a name="FNanchor_254" id="FNanchor_254"></a><a href="#Footnote_254" class="fnanchor">[254]</a> It was
adopted by the Common Council by a large majority
(viz. 98 votes to 46). At first the king was disposed
not to receive it at all. "I suppose this is another
remonstrance" he wrote to North, after telling the
sheriffs to call again "if so I think it ought not to
have any answer."<a name="FNanchor_255" id="FNanchor_255"></a><a href="#Footnote_255" class="fnanchor">[255]</a> After seeing a draft of it,
however, he changed his mind. He acknowledged
that it was less offensive than he had been given to
understand, but he thought "the whole performance"
required no more than "a short dry answer."<a name="FNanchor_256" id="FNanchor_256"></a><a href="#Footnote_256" class="fnanchor">[256]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">The king's
reply, 23 May,
1770.</div>

<p>In the ordinary course the presentation would
have been made by the Recorder on behalf of the
citizens. Eyre, however, refused to attend on this
occasion,<a name="FNanchor_257" id="FNanchor_257"></a><a href="#Footnote_257" class="fnanchor">[257]</a> so that the address may possibly have been
read by the lord mayor himself. The king's reply
was even briefer than usual. He would (he said)
have been wanting to the public and to himself had
he not expressed dissatisfaction at the former address.
He declared his sentiments to be unchanged, and he
declined to use his prerogative in a manner which might
be dangerous to the constitution of the kingdom.<a name="FNanchor_258" id="FNanchor_258"></a><a href="#Footnote_258" class="fnanchor">[258]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Beckford's
memorable
speech.</div>

<p>It was now that Beckford made that memorable
speech with which his name will ever be associated
(although claimed by Horne Tooke as his composition),
and which was afterwards inscribed, by order of the
Common Council, upon the pediment of his statue
erected in the Guildhall.<a name="FNanchor_259" id="FNanchor_259"></a><a href="#Footnote_259" class="fnanchor">[259]</a> Deeming the king's answer
unsatisfactory the mayor, to the surprise of all present,
and contrary to all form and precedent, again stept
forward, and, addressing the king, besought his majesty
to allow him&mdash;the mayor of the king's loyal city of
London&mdash;to express on behalf of his fellow citizens
their sorrow at having incurred his majesty's displeasure.
He assured the king that there were no
subjects "more faithful, more dutiful, or more
affectionate" than the citizens, and he denounced
the man who should attempt to alienate the king's
affection from his subjects in general, and from the
city of London in particular, as an enemy to the king
and constitution. Even Walpole allowed that the
speech was "wondrous loyal and respectful," if a
trifle disconcerting. The king was so much taken
by surprise that he hesitated whether to stay or
withdraw. He decided on the former, and remained
until Beckford had finished, when he immediately
got up and retired without a word. Chatham was
immensely pleased at the spirit displayed by Beckford
on this occasion, and wrote to tell him so: "The <i>spirit
of Old England</i> spoke that never-to-be-forgotten
day." His letter concludes with the following
enthusiastic passage: "Adieu, then for the present
(to call you by the most honourable of titles) <i>true</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
<i>Lord Mayor of London</i>; that is, <i>first</i> magistrate of
the <i>first</i> city of the world! I mean to tell you only
a plain truth when I say your lordship's mayoralty
will be revered till the constitution is destroyed and
forgotten."<a name="FNanchor_260" id="FNanchor_260"></a><a href="#Footnote_260" class="fnanchor">[260]</a> Beckford, in his reply, justified his
conduct. "What I spoke in the king's presence was
uttered in the language of truth, and with that
humility and submission which become a subject
speaking to his lawful king: at least I endeavoured
to behave properly and decently; but I am inclined
to believe that I was mistaken, for the language of
the court is that my deportment was impudent, insolent
and unprecedented. God forgive them all!"<a name="FNanchor_261" id="FNanchor_261"></a><a href="#Footnote_261" class="fnanchor">[261]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Vote of thanks
to Beckford
for his speech,
25 May.</div>

<p>When the matter came to be reported to the Common
Council (25 May) two aldermen, viz., Rossiter and
Harley, objected to Beckford having made a speech to
the king without instructions from the Common Council,
whilst Wilkes and the two sheriffs, Townshend and
Sawbridge, upheld his conduct. The Court then desired
Beckford to state what he had said to his majesty.
Thereupon the speech was produced and read, and
this being done a formal vote of thanks was passed to
the mayor for having presented the remonstrance, and
"for his vindicating at the foot of the throne the
loyalty and affection of the citizens of London."<a name="FNanchor_262" id="FNanchor_262"></a><a href="#Footnote_262" class="fnanchor">[262]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Vote of thanks
to Chatham,
14 May, 1770.</div>

<p>The same motive which prompted Beckford's
action in March last on the occasion of his magnificent
entertainment to the Opposition had in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>meanwhile incited the Common Council to a similar
indiscretion. On the 14th May&mdash;the day that the
last remonstrance was prepared&mdash;the Court passed a
vote of thanks to Chatham for the zeal he had shown
in support of the rights of election and petition, as
well as for his "declaration that his endeavours shall
hereafter be used that Parliaments may be restored to
their original purity by shortening their duration and
introducing a more full and equal representation."<a name="FNanchor_263" id="FNanchor_263"></a><a href="#Footnote_263" class="fnanchor">[263]</a>
Here the wish was distinctly father to the thought.
Chatham had made no such declaration. The vote
was nothing more or less than an attempt to "fix"
Chatham to a definite policy of reform just as Beckford
had previously tried to fix Rockingham and his party.
Chatham was not to be thus caught, and in his
acknowledgment of the vote he declared that as to
any assurance he was supposed to have given that he
was in favour of shorter Parliaments there had been
some misapprehension. With all deference to the sentiments
of the City he felt bound to say that he could not
recommend triennial Parliaments as a remedy for
venality in elections. He would not, however, oppose
any measure for their introduction if the country
showed itself unmistakably in favour of them.<a name="FNanchor_264" id="FNanchor_264"></a><a href="#Footnote_264" class="fnanchor">[264]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">The last days
of Beckford.</div>

<p>On the 30th May, Beckford again appeared at
court at the head of a deputation from the city to
present a formal address of congratulation from the
Common Council on the birth of another princess.
The address had been passed unanimously by the
Council, although Wilkes declared it was no time for
such compliments. The deputation met with some
little opposition on its way to St. James's, the gates at
Temple Bar being suddenly closed by the mob before
the whole of the civic party had passed through, and
they were not admitted into the presence chamber,
until the lord mayor had promised not to repeat his
former offence of making a speech.<a name="FNanchor_265" id="FNanchor_265"></a><a href="#Footnote_265" class="fnanchor">[265]</a> The next day
Beckford laid the first stone of the new gaol of
Newgate.<a name="FNanchor_266" id="FNanchor_266"></a><a href="#Footnote_266" class="fnanchor">[266]</a> This was his last appearance in public.
He had recently caught a chill whilst at Fonthill, and
this had been aggravated by his hasty return to town
in order to attend to his mayoralty duties, and the
excitement consequent thereto. For some years
past he had not enjoyed good health, and age began
to tell upon him. Even his first mayoralty in
1762-3, he entered upon with reluctance, and the
day before his election had gone so far as to petition
the Court of Aldermen to be discharged from his
aldermanry on the score of ill-health.<a name="FNanchor_267" id="FNanchor_267"></a><a href="#Footnote_267" class="fnanchor">[267]</a> He was,
as we have seen, still more reluctant to undertake
a second year of office, and only consented to do so
after pressing solicitation. On the 12th June, he was
so ill from rheumatic fever that he was unable to attend
a Court of Aldermen, and on the 21st he died.<a name="FNanchor_268" id="FNanchor_268"></a><a href="#Footnote_268" class="fnanchor">[268]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Barlow
Trecothick
mayor, June-Sept.,
1770.</div>

<p>Upon Beckford's decease Trecothick was elected
mayor for the remainder of the year. It was no
easy matter for the successor of one of the wealthiest
and most hospitable of mayors to avoid invidious
comparison, and at the close of his short term of
office Trecothick was satirised by Wilkes for not
maintaining the City's reputation for hospitality.<a name="FNanchor_269" id="FNanchor_269"></a><a href="#Footnote_269" class="fnanchor">[269]</a>
Trecothick was also out of favour with Wilkes for
having officially backed press warrants, the legality
of which was much disputed at the time. The
mayor, however, justified his conduct in this respect
to the livery when they met at Michaelmas, and
his speech was very favourably received.<a name="FNanchor_270" id="FNanchor_270"></a><a href="#Footnote_270" class="fnanchor">[270]</a> Wilkes
on the other hand was so strenuously opposed to
press warrants that he went so far as to release a
man who had been pressed for the navy, although he
had been taken by virtue of a warrant from the Lords
of the Admiralty, backed by Trecothick.<a name="FNanchor_271" id="FNanchor_271"></a><a href="#Footnote_271" class="fnanchor">[271]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Brass Crosby
elected mayor,
29 Sept., 1770.</div>

<p>When Michaelmas arrived, the livery refused to
re-elect Trecothick&mdash;as indeed Wilkes had foretold.
Bankes was again passed over, and Brass Crosby
chosen mayor for the ensuing year. In character he
was scarcely less spirited and patriotic than Beckford,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>and he was made to suffer in consequence. Very
early in his mayoralty (21 Nov.) it fell to his lot
to carry up another address and remonstrance to the
king for the dissolution of parliament, and to listen to
a curt refusal.<a name="FNanchor_272" id="FNanchor_272"></a><a href="#Footnote_272" class="fnanchor">[272]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Opinion
touching press
warrants.</div>

<p>In consequence of Wilkes's opposition to pressing
for the king's service, a system then constantly
practised owing to the necessities of the time,
the new mayor, one of his most steady adherents,
consulted Lord Chatham on the legality of press
warrants. Chatham advised him to take the opinion
of counsel on the matter, and this he accordingly
did, with the result that whilst he was advised
that press warrants, however objectionable, were
legal, the lord mayor could not legally be compelled
to sign them. At the same time counsel left it to the
mayor's consideration "whether for the peace of the
city, and preservation of the subject, he would not
conform to the practice of most of his predecessors
on such occasions." This decision being deemed
unsatisfactory, the City preferred to bestow premiums
on voluntary recruits, and the same course was
taken by other towns.<a name="FNanchor_273" id="FNanchor_273"></a><a href="#Footnote_273" class="fnanchor">[273]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">The freedom
of reporting
parliamentary
debates, 1771.</div>

<p>It is, however, for the conspicuous part he took
in the struggle for the liberty of the press that Brass
Crosby is best remembered. Great jealousy had
always existed in parliament as to reports of debates
held there, and the Commons had comparatively of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>recent date (28 Feb., 1729) passed a resolution to the
effect that it was an indignity, and a breach of
privilege, for anyone "to give in written or printed
newspapers" any account of the proceedings of the
house.<a name="FNanchor_274" id="FNanchor_274"></a><a href="#Footnote_274" class="fnanchor">[274]</a> Notwithstanding this resolution, reports of
debates continued to appear in the public press, but
always with an affectation of secrecy.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The arrest of
Wheble and
Miller, 15
March, 1771.</div>

<p>A scheme was now set on foot by Wilkes for
embroiling the House of Commons with the City.
At his instigation certain printers in the city commenced
to publish the debates without any attempt
at disguise, printing the name of each speaker in full.
Such a proceeding had always been deemed a distinct
breach of privilege. Some members of the House
speedily took offence, and the printers were ordered to
attend. As they refused to obey the summons, they
were ordered into custody. This was precisely what
Wilkes had aimed at. On the 15th March, a printer
named John Wheble was apprehended by virtue
of a proclamation, and was carried before Wilkes,
the sitting alderman, who immediately discharged
him, after binding him over to prosecute the man
who had taken him, for illegal arrest. The same
evening a messenger of the House of Commons
attempted to arrest Miller, the printer of the <i>Evening
Post</i>, under warrant of the Speaker; but the messenger
himself was taken into custody on a charge of assaulting
a freeman of the city, and carried before the
lord mayor and aldermen Wilkes and Oliver. These
magistrates declared the warrant to be illegal, not
having been backed by a magistrate of the city, and
released Miller. They at the same time bound over<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
the messenger of the House of Commons to appear to
answer a charge of assaulting a citizen of London.<a name="FNanchor_275" id="FNanchor_275"></a><a href="#Footnote_275" class="fnanchor">[275]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">The king's

<p>The king was furious at the authority of parliament
being thus openly defied by the civic magistrates,
and wrote to Lord North (17 March) to say that
unless Crosby and Oliver were not committed
forthwith to the Tower by the House of Commons
its authority would be annihilated;&mdash;"You know

<p>The House was no less indignant at being flouted

Crosby and Oliver, who were members,<a name="FNanchor_277" id="FNanchor_277"></a><a href="#Footnote_277" class="fnanchor">[277]</a> to answer
for their conduct from their places, but sent for the
clerk of the Justice Room at the Mansion House and

<div class="sidenote">Crosby and
Oliver before
the House,
19 March,
1771.</div>

<p>In the meantime Crosby, who was suffering from
a severe attack of gout, had attended in his place
(19 March). Early in the morning handbills were
distributed in the city informing the inhabitants that it
was the intention of the mayor to attend Parliament
that afternoon&mdash;"even though he should be obliged
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>to be carried in a litter"&mdash;to uphold their rights and
privileges, and calling upon them to escort him home
on his return from Westminster. Here is a description
of what took place taken from a contemporary newspaper;<a name="FNanchor_279" id="FNanchor_279"></a><a href="#Footnote_279" class="fnanchor">[279]</a>
"At two o'clock in the afternoon the right
hon. the lord mayor set out from the Mansion House
in a coach to attend the House of Commons, in pursuance
of a summons, to answer for his conduct on
Friday last. His lordship appeared very feeble and
infirm, but in good spirits. Mr. Alderman Oliver and
his lordship's chaplain, Mr. Evans, were in the same
coach. A prodigious crowd of the better sort were
at the Mansion House and in the streets near it,
who testified their approbation by repeated huzzas,
which were continued quite from the Mansion House
to the House of Commons. On his arrival there one
universal shout was heard for near three minutes;
and the people during the whole passage to the
House called out to the lord mayor as the <i>people's
friend, the guardian of the city's rights and the nation's
liberties</i>." Walpole minimises the display, and tells
his friend that although thousands of handbills were
dispersed to invite the mob to escort the mayor, not
a hundred attended.<a name="FNanchor_280" id="FNanchor_280"></a><a href="#Footnote_280" class="fnanchor">[280]</a> Having taken his seat in the
House Crosby justified his conduct by the oath that
he had taken on entering upon his mayoralty to
preserve the liberties of the citizens, and desired to be
heard by counsel.<a name="FNanchor_281" id="FNanchor_281"></a><a href="#Footnote_281" class="fnanchor">[281]</a> Before his examination had proceeded
far he was taken so seriously ill that he had
to ask leave to go home. This was accorded, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>"about five o'clock his lordship returned home,
attended by a great number of people; and the
populace took the horses out of the carriage at
St. Paul's, and drew the coach to the Mansion
House." The enquiry stood adjourned until Friday
(22 March). In the meantime, leave having been
given to him to appear by counsel, albeit with certain
reservations, a committee was appointed to employ

the House that he had received a letter from the
lord mayor to the effect that he (Crosby) was so ill
that he could not leave home, but that he would
attend in his place as soon as his health permitted.
Another adjournment was therefore made until the
following Monday (25 March), and Oliver's defence
was appointed for the same day.<a name="FNanchor_283" id="FNanchor_283"></a><a href="#Footnote_283" class="fnanchor">[283]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Crosby and

before the
House,
25 March,
1771.</div>

<p>By Monday the lord mayor had sufficiently recovered
to attend the House. At two o'clock in the
afternoon he again set out in his coach accompanied,
as before, by Oliver. Crowds again escorted them to
Westminster, and the approaches to the House were
so densely thronged that the Speaker gave orders to
have them cleared. Even Walpole acknowledges
this.<a name="FNanchor_284" id="FNanchor_284"></a><a href="#Footnote_284" class="fnanchor">[284]</a> After the orders of the day for their attendance
had been read Crosby explained how it was that no
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>counsel appeared on his behalf. In the first place
the restrictions that the House had placed upon the
appearance of counsel&mdash;viz., that they should only
be heard upon such points as did not controvert the
privileges of the House&mdash;was such as to prevent
counsel speaking on many points material to his
defence; and secondly the counsel whom he could
depend upon, and whom he wished to employ, were
on circuit. He therefore made his own defence. It
was now ten o'clock at night, and the exertion he
had undergone had rendered him so weak that he
again had to ask leave to withdraw, promising to
abide by the judgment of the House. On his return
to the city he met with another ovation, his coach
being drawn by the people all the way to the
Mansion House.<a name="FNanchor_285" id="FNanchor_285"></a><a href="#Footnote_285" class="fnanchor">[285]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Crosby

<p>After Crosby's withdrawal the debate was
continued. It was moved that the lord mayor's
discharging of Miller out of custody, and his having
held the messenger of the House to bail, was a
breach of privilege. To this was moved the previous
question, but after long debate it was rejected and
the original motion passed, order being given for the
lord mayor to attend on the following Wednesday,
if his health permitted.<a name="FNanchor_286" id="FNanchor_286"></a><a href="#Footnote_286" class="fnanchor">[286]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Oliver committed

<p>Notwithstanding the lateness of the hour, the
House called upon Oliver. The alderman, however,
did not detain them long. He declined to call
witnesses or to say anything in his defence, beyond
asserting that he had acted according to his duty,
oath, and conscience. Again there was a long debate
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>lasting until three o'clock in the morning, when the
House resolved to send him to the Tower. The
division was a small one, many members having
already gone home in disgust. Oliver was allowed
to go to his house in Fenchurch Street for a few
hours before being removed to the Tower by the
sergeant-at-arms.<a name="FNanchor_287" id="FNanchor_287"></a><a href="#Footnote_287" class="fnanchor">[287]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Speech of

<p>During the debate, Alderman Townshend appeared
in the House looking very pale, having risen
from a sickbed&mdash;"his hair lank, and his face swathed
with linen, having had his jaw laid open for an
inflammation"&mdash;and after commenting severely upon
the arbitrary action of the House in erasing a record
entered in the lord mayor's book, proceeded to twit
the government with its obsequiousness to female
caprice and boldly declared their arbitrary measures
to be due to the baneful influence of the Princess
Dowager of Wales.<a name="FNanchor_288" id="FNanchor_288"></a><a href="#Footnote_288" class="fnanchor">[288]</a> Such a declaration was not only
in bad taste, but contrary to Parliamentary usage.

received a tardy and weak denial from Lord North&mdash;a
sign that the House felt the insecurity of its position.</p>

<p>On Tuesday (26 March) a Common Council sat,

mayor during his "absence or illness." After
transacting several matters of business, the court
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>resolved unanimously "that during the confinement
of Mr. Alderman Oliver in the Tower of London

<div class="sidenote">Chatham's
opinion
on Oliver's
committal.</div>

<p>The committal of Oliver was only one of a
series of blunders of which Parliament had been guilty
since the arrest of the printers. The position of affairs
was clearly defined in letters written by Chatham
at the time. "The state of the business seems to
me clearly this: the discharge of Miller, taken
under the Speaker's warrant, I think contrary to
the established jurisdiction of the House, with
regard to printers of their proceedings and debates;
but I hold also as fully, that in a conflict of
jurisdiction, the lord mayor and city magistrates,
acting under an oath of office and their charter,
cannot be proceeded against criminally by the
House, without the highest injustice and oppression."
Again:&mdash;"the House becomes flagrantly
unjust and tyrannical, the moment it proceeds
criminally against magistrates standing for a jurisdiction
they are bound to maintain, in a conflict of
respectable rights." He goes on to say that "nothing
appears to me more distinct, than declaring their
right to jurisdiction, with regard to printers of their
proceedings and debates, and punishing their member,
and in him his constituents, for what he has
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>done in discharge of his oath and conscience as a

Crosby and Oliver "had nothing to regard but the
obligation of their oaths, and the execution of the
laws. If they were convinced that the Speaker's
warrant was not a legal authority to the messenger,
it necessarily followed that, when he was charged
upon oath with a breach of the peace, they <i>must</i>
hold him to bail. They had no option."</p>

<div class="sidenote">Crosby again
attends the

<p>On Wednesday (27 March), Crosby again
attended in his place, as directed, to hear the
decision of the House in his case. He was accompanied
as before by an "amazing number of people"
anxious to learn the issue; "guards, both horse and
foot, were ordered to be in readiness, in case any
tumult should arise. The city was all in motion;
and by its acclamations testified its satisfaction with
his conduct." Although he arrived at the House
early in the afternoon, it was past eight o'clock in
evening before the House was ready to take his
business into consideration. Meanwhile the approaches
to the House were in the hands of the mob
who threatened many of the members with violence.
Lord North, in particular, was made the object of
a violent attack. His coach was demolished and he
himself narrowly escaped being killed. Others, and
among them Charles Fox, who had made himself
especially obnoxious to the citizens by speaking of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>

insulted, but not so outrageously.<a name="FNanchor_292" id="FNanchor_292"></a><a href="#Footnote_292" class="fnanchor">[292]</a> The justices confessed
to the House their inability to read the Riot Act,

<p>The House being now prepared to proceed with
the chief business of the day, a motion was made for
committing the lord mayor to the custody of the
sergeant-at-arms, instead of sending him to the
gloomier quarters of the Tower, on account of his
ill-health. Crosby, however, at once desired that no
such favour might be shown him; he was quite
prepared, he said, to join his honourable friend in the
Tower. An amendment was accordingly moved that
he should be committed to the Tower, and this was
carried by 202 votes to 39.<a name="FNanchor_295" id="FNanchor_295"></a><a href="#Footnote_295" class="fnanchor">[295]</a> It was now past

for a short rest, and at four o'clock in the morning
sent for a hackney coach and drove to the Tower.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Letter of

<p>A few hours later the Common Council resolved
to furnish him with a "table" at the City's expense,
as they had previously done for Oliver. Both
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>prisoners acknowledged with gratitude the favour
thus shown to them by their fellow citizens, and
both promised solemnly to continue their efforts to
maintain the rights and privileges of the City, but the
lord mayor declined the offer to furnish his table
during his incarceration, as he did not wish to put
the City to any additional expense on his account.<a name="FNanchor_296" id="FNanchor_296"></a><a href="#Footnote_296" class="fnanchor">[296]</a>
Oliver's letter contained some very caustic remarks
upon the attitude of the government towards the
City. "The last ten years have afforded the city
of London, in particular, every instance of neglect,
unkindness, insult and injury; their petitions have
been rejected, slighted, ridiculed; their property unjustly
conveyed to others; their charters violated;<a name="FNanchor_297" id="FNanchor_297"></a><a href="#Footnote_297" class="fnanchor">[297]</a>
their laws contemned; their magistrates imprisoned.
The power that consumes us has the plainest and
most odious marks of despotism, abject abroad and
insolent at home. Whether our rights will in the
end be peaceably re-established or whether this
violence will be pursued is more than I can
certainly declare, but this I will venture to say for
myself that they must either change their laws or
the magistrates, for my adherence to my duty shall
be invariably the same, regardless of consequences."<a name="FNanchor_298" id="FNanchor_298"></a><a href="#Footnote_298" class="fnanchor">[298]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Supporters

<p>The temper of the populace at witnessing "the
new and extraordinary spectacle of the lord mayor
of the city of London and one of its principal magistrates
being committed prisoners to the Tower,"
vented itself in a very characteristic manner. On
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>the 1st April a great mob proceeded to Tower Hill
following a hearse and two carts, in which were
figures representing the princess dowager, Lord Bute,
the Speaker, and both the Foxes. The figures were
beheaded by a chimney sweeper, after mock prayers,
and then burnt. A like ceremony took place a few
days later with figures of Lord Halifax, Lord
Barrington, Alderman Harley, Colonel Luttrell, nicknamed
"the usurper," Lord Sandwich, otherwise
known as "Jemmy Twitcher," Colonel Onslow, who
had been made so furious because a newspaper had
called him "Cocking George," and De Grey, the
attorney-general. Their supposed dying speeches
were, to the intense amusement of the multitude,
hawked about the streets.<a name="FNanchor_299" id="FNanchor_299"></a><a href="#Footnote_299" class="fnanchor">[299]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">The contest

<p>Wilkes, who had been no less an offender (if
offence there was) in holding the Speaker's warrant
to be illegal, got off scot free. Three times was he
summoned to the bar of the House to answer for his
conduct, and three times he refused to obey unless
the House would acknowledge him as member for
Middlesex. Ministers preferred to leave him unmolested,
resorting even to a subterfuge in order to
allow him to escape. It is true that, like Lord
Shaftesbury in the reign of Charles II, he had removed
for safety from his house in Westminster to lodgings
in the city, but few can doubt his readiness, if need
be, to share the fate of his brother aldermen in so good
a cause. In the words of <i>Junius</i>, he was already
a "wounded soldier" in the cause of liberty, and
could point to "real prosecutions, real penalties, real

reward of the victory thus gained for the freedom of

<div class="sidenote">Crosby and

<p>More than one attempt was made by the

confinement, receiving a constant succession of friends
and supporters, including Edmund Burke and the
Dukes of Manchester and Portland, until set free
by the prorogation of Parliament on the 8th May.
The Common Council had, in anticipation of that
event, resolved (3 May) to go in procession in their

them from the Tower to the Mansion House.<a name="FNanchor_301" id="FNanchor_301"></a><a href="#Footnote_301" class="fnanchor">[301]</a> As

<div class="sidenote">Another

attend the presentation of the address in a body, clad

give way, and the address was presented in the

<div class="sidenote">Election of
Wilkes and
Bull, sheriffs,
3 July, 1771.</div>

<p>The more important business transacted at this
Common Hall was the election of sheriffs for the
ensuing year. Wilkes had declared his intention of
standing, and had asked Oliver&mdash;at that time a
prisoner in the Tower&mdash;if he intended doing the
same, regardless of the claims of senior aldermen.
Oliver hesitated as to the course he should pursue,
but finally wrote to Wilkes (11 April, 1771) expressing
a determination not to serve with him, inasmuch
as their political aims were not identical. Wilkes
little relished this rebuff, and took exception to the
propriety of Oliver's reply; as for himself, he said,
"I am ready to serve the office of sheriff with you,
sir, or any other gentleman given me by the livery
as a colleague, should they think proper to elect
me."<a name="FNanchor_306" id="FNanchor_306"></a><a href="#Footnote_306" class="fnanchor">[306]</a> The election was watched with great interest
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>by the king, who was afraid that Wilkes might succeed
in getting elected, although supported only by "a small,
though desperate," part of the livery, and he wrote to
Lord North expressing a hope that no effort might be
wanting to secure the election of Plumbe and Kirkman,
the two senior aldermen who had not served.<a name="FNanchor_307" id="FNanchor_307"></a><a href="#Footnote_307" class="fnanchor">[307]</a> He
was doomed to disappointment. The livery declared
for Wilkes and Frederick Bull, a creature of Wilkes,
and a poll was demanded. This lasted several days,
and on the 3rd July the result showed a large majority
in their favour, and they were declared duly elected.
Oliver came out at the bottom of the poll.<a name="FNanchor_308" id="FNanchor_308"></a><a href="#Footnote_308" class="fnanchor">[308]</a></p>

<p>The activity of court interference in this election
was revealed by an unhappy <i>contretemps</i>. A letter
which "Jack" Robinson, Lord North's secretary, had
sent to Benjamin Smith, a partner of Alderman Nash,
an "opulent grocer" of Cannon Street, urging him
to "push the poll" with as many friends as possible,
was carried by mistake to another Smith, of Budge
Row, a Wilkite, who immediately published it with
an affidavit as to its authenticity. The result was, as
might be expected, the greater discomfiture of the
ministerial candidates.<a name="FNanchor_309" id="FNanchor_309"></a><a href="#Footnote_309" class="fnanchor">[309]</a></p>

<p>Walpole was no less struck with the irrepressibility
of Wilkes's character than annoyed at his being elected
to an office which would bring him into close contact
with the king;&mdash;"Wilkes is another Ph&oelig;nix revived
from his own ashes. He was sunk&mdash;it was over with
him; but the ministers too precipitately hurrying to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>bury him alive, blew up the embers, and he is again
as formidable as ever; and what will seem worse he
must go into the very closet whenever the city sends
him there with a message.... Wilkes in prison
is chosen member of Parliament and then alderman
of London. His colleagues betray him, desert him,
expose him, and he becomes sheriff of London."<a name="FNanchor_310" id="FNanchor_310"></a><a href="#Footnote_310" class="fnanchor">[310]</a>
Walpole's fears as to Wilkes's personal demeanour in
office were groundless. As an alderman of the city he
might have made himself sufficiently obnoxious at
court had he so pleased, but he knew himself to be
no <i>persona grata</i> to the king, and on that account was
careful to keep out of his sight. That he knew how
to behave on occasion is shown by his conduct during
his mayoralty, when he surprised everybody, the
king included, by his agreeable manner.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Wilkes and
the shrievalty.</div>

<p>Although determined to act with propriety in
his personal relationships, Wilkes was no less determined
to make himself as obnoxious to the king and
his ministers as he well could in his official capacity
as sheriff. "I will skirmish with the great almost
every day in some way or other," he wrote to <i>Junius</i>.
Again, with reference to the House of Lords, he
informs his friend that "the sheriff means the attack."<a name="FNanchor_311" id="FNanchor_311"></a><a href="#Footnote_311" class="fnanchor">[311]</a>
A few days previous to his entering upon his duties
he and his colleague, Bull, made a bid for popularity
by a spirited act. The presence of the military at
executions had been resented the previous year, and
now in a short letter addressed to the livery they
announced their determination to follow the example
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>set by their predecessors in office and not to allow
soldiers to attend: "We are determined to follow so
meritorious an example, and as that melancholy
part of our office will commence in a very few days
we take this opportunity of declaring that as the
constitution has entrusted us with the whole power
of the county, we will not, during our sheriffalty,
suffer any part of the army to interfere or even to
attend, as on many former occasions, on the pretence
of aiding or assisting the civil magistrate.... The
magistrate, with the assistance of those in his
jurisdiction, is by experience known to be strong
enough to enforce all legal commands, without the
aid of a standing army." <i>Junius</i> thought this letter
"very proper and well drawn."<a name="FNanchor_312" id="FNanchor_312"></a><a href="#Footnote_312" class="fnanchor">[312]</a></p>

<p>Another proceeding on the part of Wilkes failed
however to meet with like approval. The 25th
October being the anniversary of the king's accession,
there was to be a thanksgiving service at St. Paul's
which the sheriffs in the ordinary course of their
duties would be expected to attend. Wilkes took it
into his head that he would prefer not to go "in
a ginger-bread chariot to yawn through a dull
sermon." He accordingly prepared a letter to the
lord mayor, asking that he might be allowed to sit at
Old Bailey instead of taking part in what he called a
"vain parade" on the anniversary of the accession
of a prince, whose government was so unpopular.
Before sending this missive he submitted it to <i>Junius</i>.<a name="FNanchor_313" id="FNanchor_313"></a><a href="#Footnote_313" class="fnanchor">[313]</a>
The latter thought it "more spirited than judicious,"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>and suggested that it was impolitic, to say the least,
for "a grave sheriff" to mark his entrance into office
with a direct outrage to the king, for outrage it
was. He advises his friend to "consider the matter
coolly," but in case Wilkes persisted, he sent him
a more temperate form of letter.<a name="FNanchor_314" id="FNanchor_314"></a><a href="#Footnote_314" class="fnanchor">[314]</a> The advice thus
given was followed, and Wilkes abandoned his intention.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Letter of
<i>Junius</i> to
Wilkes,

1771.</div>

<p>Wilkes had thus advanced another step in civic
life, in spite of an unfortunate habit he had of
quarrelling with his best friends. He had disgusted,
or had himself thrown over, Horne, Sawbridge,
Townshend and Oliver, all of whom were members
with him of the society known as the Supporters of the
Bill of Rights, and all had contributed towards relieving
him of his pecuniary difficulties. Townshend and
Horne had recently joined forces "to wrest the city
out of Wilkes's hands," and Horne had done his best in
a quiet way to prevent Wilkes being returned as sheriff,
although he denied taking any part in the election.<a name="FNanchor_315" id="FNanchor_315"></a><a href="#Footnote_315" class="fnanchor">[315]</a> He
even ridiculed the idea in a letter to Wilkes (10 July),
commencing "Give you joy, Sir,<a name="FNanchor_316" id="FNanchor_316"></a><a href="#Footnote_316" class="fnanchor">[316]</a> the parson of
Brentford is at length defeated. He no longer rules
with an absolute sway over the city of London."<a name="FNanchor_317" id="FNanchor_317"></a><a href="#Footnote_317" class="fnanchor">[317]</a>
Wilkes was now to receive support from a quarter
least expected. Hitherto, the redoubtable <i>Junius</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>had treated Wilkes with little more than contempt.<a name="FNanchor_318" id="FNanchor_318"></a><a href="#Footnote_318" class="fnanchor">[318]</a>
He was now to become one of his warmest supporters.
It was not that <i>Junius</i> entertained any
great respect for Wilkes; it was enough that Wilkes
was opposed to the ministry, and that he promised to
be "a thorn in the king's side."<a name="FNanchor_319" id="FNanchor_319"></a><a href="#Footnote_319" class="fnanchor">[319]</a> On the 21st August,
about noon, Wilkes received a mysterious letter,<a name="FNanchor_320" id="FNanchor_320"></a><a href="#Footnote_320" class="fnanchor">[320]</a>
the writer of which proved to be <i>Junius</i> himself.
After assuring Wilkes of his willingness to support
him so long as he (Wilkes) depended only upon
public favour and made common cause with the
people, <i>Junius</i> comes to the real purport of his
letter. He was especially anxious that Sawbridge
should be chosen mayor at the coming election on
Michaelmas-day, and he uses all his art of persuasion
upon Wilkes to get him to support Sawbridge's
candidature. He repudiates all idea of self-interest
in wishing to see Sawbridge in the mayoralty chair
in place of Crosby, who was reported to be seeking a
second year of office. "By all that's honourable
I mean nothing but the cause"&mdash;his letter concluded&mdash;"and
I may defy your keenest penetration
to assign a satisfactory reason why <i>Junius</i>, whoever
he be, should have a personal interest in giving
the mayoralty to Mr. Sawbridge, rather than to
Mr. Crosby."</p>

<div class="sidenote">The reply
of Wilkes,

<p>The letter was very flattering, and Wilkes was
pleased. "I am satisfied that <i>Junius</i> now means me

to merit more than his regard, his friendship," but
with his usual independence he declined to desert
Brass Crosby, to whom he had promised his support
before the arrival of <i>Junius's</i> letter. He was even
prepared to do a little juggling in order to support
Crosby's re-election. "To make Crosby mayor, it is
necessary to return to the Court of Aldermen
another man so obnoxious that it is impossible
for them to elect him. Bridgen I take to be
this man. While he presided in the city, he
treated them with insolence, was exceedingly rude
and scurrilous to them personally, starved them
at the few entertainments he gave, and pocketed
the city cash.<a name="FNanchor_321" id="FNanchor_321"></a><a href="#Footnote_321" class="fnanchor">[321]</a>" Even if Bridgen were re-elected by
any chance, Crosby would probably be appointed his
<i>locum tenens</i> (Wilkes proceeded to point out), and so
in any event all would be well. As for Sawbridge,
little good could come of a reconciliation, "I allow
him honest, but think he has more mulishness than
understanding, more understanding than candour."
Sawbridge moreover had already declared, that if he
were chosen mayor at the next election he would
pay fine rather than serve, "because Townshend
ought to be mayor"&mdash;a declaration which Wilkes
characterises as bordering on insanity.<a name="FNanchor_322" id="FNanchor_322"></a><a href="#Footnote_322" class="fnanchor">[322]</a></p>

<p>The correspondence thus commenced in so warm
and friendly a manner was continued for several
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>months. Finding himself unable to prevail upon
Wilkes to become reconciled with Sawbridge, <i>Junius</i>
contented himself with warning him at all hazards
not to allow a "ministerial alderman" to be elected
into the mayoralty chair, and begging that if after a
fair canvas of the livery it was found that Bridgen
had no chance of being returned, he would give up
the point at once, and let Sawbridge be returned with
Crosby&mdash;"a more likely way, in <i>my</i> judgment, to
make Crosby lord mayor."<a name="FNanchor_323" id="FNanchor_323"></a><a href="#Footnote_323" class="fnanchor">[323]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">The election
of Nash,
Mayor,
8 Oct., 1771.</div>

<p>When the election came on, Bridgen was not
even nominated. The choice of the livery was
declared to have fallen on Sawbridge and Crosby.
Thereupon a poll was demanded on behalf of Bankes,
Nash, Hallifax and Townshend. Whilst the poll
was proceeding <i>Junius</i> issued an impassioned address
to the livery calling upon them to set aside Nash&mdash;to
whom he refers as the senior alderman below
the chair, which Nash was not<a name="FNanchor_324" id="FNanchor_324"></a><a href="#Footnote_324" class="fnanchor">[324]</a>&mdash;and to return
Crosby and Sawbridge, men who were ready to
execute the extraordinary as well as the ordinary
duties of the mayoralty, who would grant Common
Halls whenever necessary, carry up remonstrances to
the king, and not be afraid to face the House of
Commons or to suffer imprisonment. Of Nash's
private character he declared he knew nothing, but
as a public man he knew him to have done everything
in his power to destroy the freedom of popular
election in the city, and to have distinguished himself
by thwarting the livery. He concludes his address
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>by apologising for his passionate language.&mdash;"The
subject comes home to us all. It is the language of
my heart."<a name="FNanchor_325" id="FNanchor_325"></a><a href="#Footnote_325" class="fnanchor">[325]</a> The efforts of <i>Junius</i> were of little
avail. On the 8th October, the result of the poll was
declared, and Nash and Sawbridge being returned (the
former by a large majority), the Court of Aldermen
selected Nash to be mayor for the ensuing year.
The "ministerial candidate" had got in. During the
election Wilkes and his brother aldermen, Townshend
and Sawbridge, were frequently at loggerheads, whilst
Nash was so grievously assaulted on his way to the
Guildhall that his life was in danger.<a name="FNanchor_326" id="FNanchor_326"></a><a href="#Footnote_326" class="fnanchor">[326]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Nash refuses
to summon a
Common
Hall,
Feb., 1772.</div>

<p>Nash had not long been mayor before he
came into collision both with the livery and the
Common Council. When a requisition was made
to him in February, 1772, to summon a Common
Hall for the purpose of instructing the city members
to support Sawbridge in one of his many attempts to
obtain triennial parliaments, he refused to do so on the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>ground that by an order of the livery of Midsummer-day
last, the question of the rights of the livery
was about to be decided in a court of law, informations
having been laid against those companies who
had refused to obey the mayor's precept.<a name="FNanchor_328" id="FNanchor_328"></a><a href="#Footnote_328" class="fnanchor">[328]</a> He
thought that in the meantime it would be well to
suspend the exercise of his prerogative, more especially
as most matters of importance connected with the
city could be settled by the Common Council, which
he professed himself always ready to call when
necessity required. Not satisfied with his reply the
livery held an informal meeting at the Half Moon
Tavern in Cheapside, and persuaded a number of
members of the Common Council to make a written
application to the mayor to summon a court on the
18th February, for the purpose of considering the
request of the livery. The mayor agreed to summon
a court but declined to allow the application of the
livery to be placed on the paper of business. A Common
Council was eventually summoned for the 20th,
when the several applications of the livery and of the
members of the court having been read, a motion
was made that the Common Council should give
instructions to the city members to support Sawbridge's
bill. This motion being lost, another was
made and carried, desiring the lord mayor to summon
a Common Hall for the same purpose. Thereupon
Nash addressed the court in these words:&mdash;"I am
very sorry this question has been put, I cannot
grant your request for the reasons given in my
former answer to the livery to which I refer you."
After passing a resolution that such members of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
court as were also members of parliament, should be
requested to support every measure tending to
shorten the duration of parliaments, the court proceeded
to consider whether it should not on its own
responsibility issue precepts for a Common Hall. It
was at length decided to leave this question to a
committee.<a name="FNanchor_329" id="FNanchor_329"></a><a href="#Footnote_329" class="fnanchor">[329]</a> <i>Junius</i> was very disgusted at Nash's
conduct. "What an abandoned prostituted idiot is
your lord mayor,"&mdash;is the choice expression he makes
use of to Woodfall, his printer. Again, "the shameful
mismanagement which brought him into office, gave
me the first and unconquerable disgust."<a name="FNanchor_330" id="FNanchor_330"></a><a href="#Footnote_330" class="fnanchor">[330]</a> In the
following May the committee just mentioned recommended
that counsel's opinion should be taken on the

motion had been rejected, and all immediate necessity
for an extraordinary Common Hall had passed away.<a name="FNanchor_331" id="FNanchor_331"></a><a href="#Footnote_331" class="fnanchor">[331]</a>

<div class="sidenote">Instructions
of livery to
city members,
<i>re</i> short
parliaments,
24 June, 1772.</div>

<p>Matters remained as they were until Midsummer-day,
when the livery took the opportunity of a meeting
of Common Hall to draw up instructions to the city
members to support Sawbridge and short parliaments.
The terms of the address were scarcely such as a
member of Parliament of the present day would
tolerate from his constituents:&mdash;"When we made
choice of you, sirs, to transact our business in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>Parliament we considered all of you to be possessed
of fortune sufficient to render you independent;
but such is the depravity of the present age that
the more wealthy seem the easiest to be corrupted.
Altho' some of you may have approved yourselves
worthy of the confidence reposed in you, yet others,
we are sorry to be obliged to observe, have been
deficient in their duty. It becomes necessary,
therefore, that we should exercise our indisputable
right of instructing you, our representatives." All
the oppression under which the country had suffered
for the last thirteen years were due (they said) to
long parliaments. As for the existing House they
had not a good word to say. What (they asked) was
to be thought of a House "which, devoid of all
decency, could force the poor timid servant of a
corporation to erase a judicial record&mdash;an House
that could even punish two members of its own
body in a most arbitrary manner for acting with
integrity in a judicial capacity, nay! for adhering
to their charters and their oaths, and virtuously
administering justice!" Experience had taught them
that what had been intended as a bulwark of their
liberties had become a mere engine of oppression.
A worthy alderman of the city (they declared in
conclusion) had realised the danger of septennial
parliaments, and had more than once endeavoured
to shorten their duration, but unfortunately he
had not received the support he deserved. As
Sawbridge would no doubt renew his motion in the
coming winter they insisted that each member should
"afford him all possible support in order to restore
us to our antient right of annually electing our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
representatives in Parliament."<a name="FNanchor_333" id="FNanchor_333"></a><a href="#Footnote_333" class="fnanchor">[333]</a> Brave words,
these! but all to little purpose. The Septennial
Act outlived this and many another effort to obtain
its repeal, and remains in force to this day.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Townshend
elected mayor,
24 Oct., 1772.</div>

<p>The election of a mayor to succeed Nash was
keenly contested. Bankes, Hallifax and Shakespeare
were the senior aldermen below the chair, but these
were set aside by the livery in favour of Wilkes and
Townshend. A poll was demanded, and the business
of taking the poll lasted until the 8th October. The
king was in a great state of excitement, and was kept
posted up by Lord North with each day's proceedings.
"I trust by your account of this day's poll," he wrote
to the minister (3 Oct.),<a name="FNanchor_334" id="FNanchor_334"></a><a href="#Footnote_334" class="fnanchor">[334]</a> "that there can be no doubt
that it will end favourably; the mob being less quiet
this day is a proof that to [<i>sic</i>] <i>riot</i>, not numbers, the
<i>patriots</i> alone can draw advantage." Again on the
5th October, when the voice of the city was evidently
in favour of Wilkes, he writes: "The unpromising
appearance of this day's poll does not in the least
surprise me, knowing that Wilkes is not bound by
any tyes, therefore would poll non-freemen rather
than lose the election." He fancied that if Wilkes
failed to get returned as one of the two to be submitted
to the Court of Aldermen for selection he
would not be allowed to stand again,<a name="FNanchor_335" id="FNanchor_335"></a><a href="#Footnote_335" class="fnanchor">[335]</a> but here the
king was in error. His hopes were damped by Wilkes
being returned at the head of the poll, followed closely
by Townshend, their respective votes being 2,301 and
2,278.<a name="FNanchor_336" id="FNanchor_336"></a><a href="#Footnote_336" class="fnanchor">[336]</a> Although Townshend and Wilkes were at the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>time personal enemies, yet many of Wilkes's friends
were induced to give Townshend their second votes,
in order to prevent a "court candidate" being successful.
This at least is Horace Walpole's account, who
declares that Townshend "disdained to canvass or
even to attend the election," and that without the
assistance of Wilkes's supporters he would have had
"scarce any votes." On the other hand we must
remember that, intense as was the personal animosity
at this time between Townshend and Wilkes, both of
them had one and the same political object in view,
viz., the overthrow of the government, and Townshend
must have added considerably to his popularity in the
city by his recent refusal to pay his land tax on the
plea that the Parliament which had ordained it was
no true Parliament owing to the exclusion of Wilkes
and intrusion of Luttrell.<a name="FNanchor_337" id="FNanchor_337"></a><a href="#Footnote_337" class="fnanchor">[337]</a> The king's only remaining
hope was that the result of the poll might be upset
by a scrutiny demanded on behalf of Hallifax and
Shakespeare. "I hope the scrutiny will be conducted
with great exactness," he again writes to Lord North
(6 Oct.), at the same time expressing a doubt as to
whether such a thing was to be expected from Oliver
and Watkin Lewes, who had succeeded Wilkes and
Bull in the shrievalty. If these did their duty he felt
sure it would go hard with Wilkes, whose "little
regard to true votes" would soon be exposed, and
"do him great injury, even among his admirers."<a name="FNanchor_338" id="FNanchor_338"></a><a href="#Footnote_338" class="fnanchor">[338]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span></p>

<p>Again the king was doomed to disappointment. The
scrutiny, according to the Minutes of the Proceedings
of the Common Hall preserved at the Guildhall, continued
until the 24th day of the month, when the votes
for each candidate were declared to be exactly the
same as before, and Wilkes and Townshend being
returned to the Court of Aldermen for their selection
of one, that body chose Townshend to be mayor for
the ensuing year. According to Walpole<a name="FNanchor_339" id="FNanchor_339"></a><a href="#Footnote_339" class="fnanchor">[339]</a> the scrutiny
was not proceeded with, and Wilkes was certain of
being elected (Townshend being expected to withdraw
in his favour) had not alderman and sheriff Oliver, his
former friend, brought about his defeat by hastily
collecting a Court of Aldermen before the Wilkite
aldermen could take their seats, and getting Townshend
named lord mayor. Such a proceeding on the
part of Oliver is scarcely probable, if, indeed possible,
and receives no corroboration from the City's record
of what took place.<a name="FNanchor_340" id="FNanchor_340"></a><a href="#Footnote_340" class="fnanchor">[340]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Riot at the

<p>On lord mayor's day the partisans of Wilkes,
smarting at their defeat, raised a riot at night outside
the Guildhall, where a ball was being held. The
assistance of the Artillery Company had to be called
in, and they remained on duty all night. The new
lord mayor, who was somewhat hot-headed, "proposed
to sally out with drawn swords and fall on
the mob," but was restrained. He, however, caused
some of the rioters to be seized and committed to
Newgate, and declared that he would bring home the
riot to Wilkes. The whole city was now, and had
been for some time, so split up into factions that even
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>a vote of thanks to the Artillery Company for striving
to keep order was with difficulty passed.<a name="FNanchor_341" id="FNanchor_341"></a><a href="#Footnote_341" class="fnanchor">[341]</a> "A headstrong,

"saw those who would have gone farthest to stem

<p>Following in the steps of Sawbridge, his brother

introduced a motion before the Court of Aldermen
on the 16th February (1773) to the effect "that a
frequent appeal to the constituent part of the
people by short parliaments is their undoubted right

Wilkes was the only alderman who raised any

but he dared not do so. The motion was therefore
carried unanimously.<a name="FNanchor_345" id="FNanchor_345"></a><a href="#Footnote_345" class="fnanchor">[345]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Another

<p>Three weeks later (11 March) a special Common

the livery and the city members to use their utmost
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>endeavours to obtain shorter parliaments. This new
remonstrance&mdash;a "flagrant piece of impertinence," as
the king styled it in a letter to Lord North (13 March)<a name="FNanchor_346" id="FNanchor_346"></a><a href="#Footnote_346" class="fnanchor">[346]</a>&mdash;was
said to have been the work of Wilkes, who
drafted it in such terms that his enemy the lord mayor
"would be undone at St. James's if he presented it,
and stoned by the people if he did not."<a name="FNanchor_347" id="FNanchor_347"></a><a href="#Footnote_347" class="fnanchor">[347]</a> It was
resolved that the remonstrance should be presented

sheriffs and ten of the livery in their gowns, attended
by the Recorder and city officers.<a name="FNanchor_348" id="FNanchor_348"></a><a href="#Footnote_348" class="fnanchor">[348]</a> Wilkes showed
considerable shrewdness in declining to attend, excusing
himself on the ground that he knew himself to
be personally disliked by the king. He would, he
said, willingly have attended had he been sheriff, but
now that he was only an alderman there was no
reason for him to thrust himself where he was not
wanted. "I am not used to go into any gentleman's
house who does not wish to see me."<a name="FNanchor_349" id="FNanchor_349"></a><a href="#Footnote_349" class="fnanchor">[349]</a> Even the
livery seemed to shrink from having a hand in presenting
so disreputable an address, for only eight of
them attended at St. James's.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The king's

26 March.</div>

<p>The document was presented to the king on Friday,
the 26th March. It was (presumably) received on the
throne, although the Common Council do not appear
to have been present to give it a corporate character.
A copy of it had previously reached the king's hands,
and he had made up his mind, as he told Lord North,<a name="FNanchor_350" id="FNanchor_350"></a><a href="#Footnote_350" class="fnanchor">[350]</a>
that a "dry answer, rather bordering on contempt than
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>anger," was the most suitable reply to make to a
representation at once "the most violent, insolent and
licentious ever presented." The answer he actually
returned was more than "dry," and the deputation
was dismissed with his majesty declaring that their
petition was so void of foundation, and withal so disrespectful,
that "I am convinced you do not yourselves
seriously imagine it can be complied with."<a name="FNanchor_351" id="FNanchor_351"></a><a href="#Footnote_351" class="fnanchor">[351]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Wilkes again
claims his

<p>A month later an opportunity was afforded Wilkes
of again claiming his seat in Parliament. War with
France seemed imminent, and a call of the House<a name="FNanchor_352" id="FNanchor_352"></a><a href="#Footnote_352" class="fnanchor">[352]</a> was
moved for the 26th April. The sheriffs of London<a name="FNanchor_353" id="FNanchor_353"></a><a href="#Footnote_353" class="fnanchor">[353]</a>
thereupon sent a summons to Wilkes (<i>not</i> Luttrell) as
member for Middlesex, and informed the Speaker of
what they had done. Wilkes also wrote a bold
letter to the Speaker asserting his right. On the day
of the call Wilkes went to the crown office and
demanded his writ, which was refused him by the
deputy-clerk. Thence he proceeded to Westminster,
attended by his friends and supporters. The guards
were held in readiness, but there was no disturbance.
Glynn&mdash;recently appointed Recorder of London&mdash;moved
that Wilkes should be heard at the bar of the
House as to his complaint against the deputy-clerk,
and the motion was seconded by Sawbridge. The
House was in no mood, however, to meet one who

<p>When Midsummer-day (1773) came round Plumbe

paid fine and Lee was elected in his place. The
livery being determined more than ever to win their
independence and to break away from the authority
of the mayor, took the opportunity of their meeting
together to consult the new Recorder upon the
question "whether the livery of London legally
assembled in Common Hall, either on this or any
other day, have not a right to enter upon any
matter of public grievance they may think proper?"
Glynn at once replied that they had an undoubted
right, and that it was "beyond dispute that the right

<div class="sidenote">Plumbe's case.</div>

<p>The aspirations of the livery were (at least for a
time) damped by the decision given a few weeks
later in a case known as "Plumbe's case." It will be
remembered that in 1770 certain livery companies had
objected to the tone of a recent remonstrance, and
had in consequence passed resolutions forbidding their
members to attend Common Halls except for the
purpose of elections. A joint committee of the
livery and the Common Council had thereupon been
appointed to take counsel's opinion upon the rights
of the livery.<a name="FNanchor_357" id="FNanchor_357"></a><a href="#Footnote_357" class="fnanchor">[357]</a> Among the counsel consulted on the
question was Glynn, and he and his brethren had given
it as their opinion (June, 1771) that the mayor for the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>time being might legally summon a Common Hall;
that it was the duty of those livery companies to
whom precepts were sent by the mayor to execute
those precepts, and that a wilful refusal was punishable
by disfranchisement, the procedure being by way
of information filed by the common sergeant in the
mayor's court. Informations had accordingly been
filed against the masters or wardens of the several
companies of Goldsmiths, Weavers and Grocers by
order of Common Hall,<a name="FNanchor_358" id="FNanchor_358"></a><a href="#Footnote_358" class="fnanchor">[358]</a> but only one, viz., that
against Alderman Plumbe, of the Goldsmiths, was
proceeded with. The question was tried before a
jury on the 14th July of this year (1773) with the
result that Plumbe was convicted and adjudged to
be disfranchised.<a name="FNanchor_359" id="FNanchor_359"></a><a href="#Footnote_359" class="fnanchor">[359]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Counsel's
opinion on
the powers of
Common
Hall.</div>

<p>The powers of the livery were further defined in
a legal opinion delivered about this time by the Recorder
and Common Sergeant on the questions (1) Whether
the lord mayor, aldermen and livery of London in
Common Hall assembled could do any corporate act
except under the powers given them by Acts of
Parliament; (2) Whether an order of the livery in
Common Hall to the Town Clerk to affix his signature
to such a document as the last remonstrance
would be a sufficient justification for him in a court of
law in case of a criminal prosecution; and lastly (3)
Whether individuals signing such a remonstrance be
liable to a prosecution of libel? To the first two
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>questions counsel made the following answer;&mdash;"From
the best information wee can get of the usage and
constitution of the City the Common Hall is not
empowered to do any act strictly corporate not
having the direction of the City Seal. They can do
no act that binds the estate of the City or that
effects the admission or removal of any of its
members." Then, referring to the former opinion
of the Recorder just mentioned, they proceeded to
say;&mdash;"wee did in concurrence with Mr. Solicitor-General
and Mr. Dunning upon consideration give
an opinion that a Common Hall was a lawful
assembly vested with legal powers. Wee find that
opinion warranted by Lord Coke's authority, and
therefore without more research and enquiry than
can now be made, wee cannot alter our opinion."
They were further of opinion "that no Act of Common
Hall can endanger the Charters or Franchises of the
city, and wee think that the right of petitioning a
necessary consequence of a lawful assembly." As a
result of their answer to the first question they
believed that the Town Clerk, being by office the
clerk of a legally convened meeting of the Common
Hall, would not render himself criminally liable by
giving his signature to the acts and resolutions of that
assembly. As to the question of libel, that depended
upon a variety of circumstances, but in their private
opinion counsel believed that no one presenting the late
remonstrance could be treated legally as a criminal.<a name="FNanchor_360" id="FNanchor_360"></a><a href="#Footnote_360" class="fnanchor">[360]</a></p>

<p>At Michaelmas, Wilkes again put up for the
mayoralty, but although he was again returned at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>
head of the poll he was again rejected by the Court
of Aldermen in favour of his friend Bull.<a name="FNanchor_361" id="FNanchor_361"></a><a href="#Footnote_361" class="fnanchor">[361]</a> Before the
end of the year Bull was also chosen member for the
City in the place of Ladbroke, who had died. A petition
was laid before Parliament against his election, and in
favour of his opponent, John Roberts, a court candidate,
but was afterwards withdrawn.<a name="FNanchor_362" id="FNanchor_362"></a><a href="#Footnote_362" class="fnanchor">[362]</a> The king had at
one time expressed himself to North as thinking it
best not to offer any opposition to Bull's election as
member for the city, unless there was a good hope
of success. "If Alderman Bull can be with success
opposed, I should think it eligible; but if that is
not pretty certain it is best not to interfere."<a name="FNanchor_363" id="FNanchor_363"></a><a href="#Footnote_363" class="fnanchor">[363]</a> On
learning, however, that Roberts, a former director of
the East India Company, was about to stand he wished
him success.<a name="FNanchor_364" id="FNanchor_364"></a><a href="#Footnote_364" class="fnanchor">[364]</a> Previous to his election Bull signed an
engagement (formulated by the livery at their meeting
in March), to use his best endeavours to shorten the
duration of parliaments; to exclude pensioners and
placemen from the House; to establish a fair and
equal representation of the people in Parliament;
and to redress the grievances and secure the
constitutional rights of his fellow subjects in Great
Britain, Ireland and America. He also solemnly
promised not to accept from the crown or its
ministers any place, pension, contract, title, gratuity
or emolument whatsoever.<a name="FNanchor_365" id="FNanchor_365"></a><a href="#Footnote_365" class="fnanchor">[365]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">England and
the American
colonies,
1765-1774.</div>

<p>It was during Bull's mayoralty that the relations
between England and her American colonies became
so strained that in 1775 the two countries were at
open war. For the past ten years the colonies had
displayed more or less resistance to the British
government. In 1765 the Stamp Act was passed,
and in the following year it had to be repealed. The
irritation caused by its imposition remained, however,
and the colonists began to ignore the authority
of British Acts of Parliament. In 1767 another
Act was passed by Parliament imposing import
duties in America upon certain articles, and among
them upon tea; but the Act was rendered from the
outset almost a dead letter through the resistance
offered to the execution of its provisions. Matters
were not improved by the repeal of all the duties,
except that on tea, three years later (1770), more
especially when the Americans learnt that Lord
North openly acknowledged that he retained the
tea duty, not on account of its value, but simply
in order to assert the right of England to tax her
colonies. The crisis came in 1773, when the tea-ships
lying in Boston harbour were attacked, and
their cargo flung into the sea. In September of
the following year (1774) all the American colonies
agreed to combine in stopping commercial intercourse
with Great Britain until their grievances were
redressed.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The city and
the Quebec
Bill, 1774.</div>

<p>In the meantime a Bill had passed the Lords,
and been sent down to the Commons, giving a
constitution to Canada. The City presented a strong
petition against the Bill (3 June) as unduly favouring
the Roman Catholics, and begged the king to withhold<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>
his assent after the Bill had passed both Houses.<a name="FNanchor_366" id="FNanchor_366"></a><a href="#Footnote_366" class="fnanchor">[366]</a> It
was to no purpose. The country generally, and the
clergy of the Established Church more particularly,
showed great indifference,<a name="FNanchor_367" id="FNanchor_367"></a><a href="#Footnote_367" class="fnanchor">[367]</a> and the Bill became law.
The mayor received a letter of thanks from the
Protestant settlers in Quebec, through Francis Maseres,
(Cursitor Baron) for what the City had done in the
matter; and the City thus encouraged resolved to
continue its efforts and endeavour to get the Act
repealed as soon as possible.<a name="FNanchor_368" id="FNanchor_368"></a><a href="#Footnote_368" class="fnanchor">[368]</a> The king was strongly
of opinion that the agitation in the City was merely
got up "just to make a noise" at the coming elections
in Common Hall,<a name="FNanchor_369" id="FNanchor_369"></a><a href="#Footnote_369" class="fnanchor">[369]</a> and Walpole appears to have been
much of the same opinion. He believed it was a
move on the part of Wilkes in order to carry the
election of sheriffs. By getting two friends appointed
sheriffs he would be in a position to get Reynolds,
his own attorney and election agent, appointed
under-sheriff, and so "be more sure of the returning
officer against the general election," which was fast
approaching.<a name="FNanchor_370" id="FNanchor_370"></a><a href="#Footnote_370" class="fnanchor">[370]</a> If this were so his scheme was
frustrated for his nominees failed to get elected.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Wilkes elected
mayor,
8 Oct., 1774.</div>

<p>His star nevertheless was soon to be again in the
ascendant. At the next election to the mayoralty,
he was not only again returned at the head of the
poll, but second to him was Bull, his friend, and
actual mayor. The other candidates who went to
the poll were James Esdaile and Brackley Kennet,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>both of them senior to Wilkes. Hallifax and
Shakespeare, the senior of all did not even go to
the poll. Sawbridge who was next below Wilkes
did not press his candidature, as the latter&mdash;according
to Walpole&mdash;"had regained him by promising to
bring him into parliament for the city." According
to the same authority Wilkes "made" Bull decline
the chair a second time, and hence it came to pass
that when these two were returned to the Court of
Aldermen, eleven voted for Wilkes, whilst only two,
viz., Townshend and Oliver, voted for Bull. "Thus,
after so much persecution of the court, after so many
attempts on his life, after a long imprisonment in a
goal, after all his crimes and indiscretions, did this
extraordinary man, of more extraordinary fortune,
attain the highest office in so grave and important
a city as the capital of England."<a name="FNanchor_371" id="FNanchor_371"></a><a href="#Footnote_371" class="fnanchor">[371]</a> That night
Alderman Harley, an old opponent of Wilkes, had
his windows broken, and the culprit was carried before
Wilkes himself.<a name="FNanchor_372" id="FNanchor_372"></a><a href="#Footnote_372" class="fnanchor">[372]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Takes his
seat as
M.P. for
Middlesex,
Nov., 1774.</div>

<p>Nor did his success end here. The mayoralty
election was still pending when parliament was
dissolved (30 Sept.), and writs issued for a new
one to meet on the 29th November. Wilkes was
again returned for Middlesex and with him his
friend, Glynn, the Recorder. The popularity of
Wilkes was indeed now so great that he was believed
to be capable of carrying no less than twelve
seats. Prior to their election both candidates signed
an undertaking to use their best endeavours to shorten
the duration of parliaments, remove placemen and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>pensioners from the House, advocate the repeal
of the Quebec Act, and generally to follow the line
of policy adopted by the livery of London, and
recently accepted by Bull.<a name="FNanchor_373" id="FNanchor_373"></a><a href="#Footnote_373" class="fnanchor">[373]</a> When the City elections
came on, Bull and Oliver kept their seats, although
Oliver declined to enter into any engagement. Wilkes
kept his promise with Sawbridge (if any were really
given), and Sawbridge was returned together with
Wilkes's own brother-in-law, George Hayley. The
irrepressible demagogue was at last allowed to take
his seat without any opposition. Had he been
permitted to have done so five years before, he
would probably have sunk into insignificance, but
now he "forced his way triumphantly, and came
vested with the insignia of the first magistracy in
England, and supported by half a dozen members
of his own nomination."<a name="FNanchor_374" id="FNanchor_374"></a><a href="#Footnote_374" class="fnanchor">[374]</a> His triumph was complete
in 1782, when he succeeded in getting the House to
stultify itself by rescinding its proceedings touching
the Middlesex elections.<a name="FNanchor_375" id="FNanchor_375"></a><a href="#Footnote_375" class="fnanchor">[375]</a> In the dogged persistence
with which he fought the House of Commons and
finally came off victorious, he reminds us of no one so
much as of the late Charles Bradlaugh, member for
Northampton; in other respects the two characters
will not bear comparison.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXXIX" id="CHAPTER_XXXIX">CHAPTER XXXIX.</a></h2>


<div class="sidenote">Wilkes and
the Court of
Aldermen.</div>

<p>Wilkes had not long occupied the mayoralty
chair before he came into serious collision with the
Court of Aldermen. In November (1774) an election
of an alderman for the Ward of Bridge Within took
place, and John Hart, one of the sheriffs, was returned
at the head of the poll, defeating his opponent, William
Neate, by four votes. A scrutiny was demanded, and,
in spite of an objection raised by Hart on technical
grounds, was allowed to proceed. Whilst the scrutiny
was proceeding Hart appeared before the Court of
Aldermen and claimed to be admitted to his seat.
Neate was also in attendance, but the Court declined
to hear him. Wilkes thereupon adjourned the Court
until after the result of the scrutiny was known. On
the 24th November the votes were cast up in the
presence of Wilkes and his predecessor in office (under
whom the original wardmote for the election had been
held), when there appeared 95 votes for Neate, as
against 84 for Hart. The result of the poll was thus
reversed. Nevertheless, when the Court of Aldermen
met the next day they insisted upon Wilkes putting
the question for Hart to be called in and sworn, whilst
they persistently refused to hear Neate or his attorney,
Reynolds&mdash;Wilkes's own friend and election agent.
This he positively refused to do, and the matter was
allowed to stand over, both parties having in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>
meantime applied to the King's Bench for writs of
<i>mandamus</i>.<a name="FNanchor_376" id="FNanchor_376"></a><a href="#Footnote_376" class="fnanchor">[376]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Comments of
the <i>Public
Advertiser</i>,
28 Nov.,
1774.</div>

<p>The proceedings of the aldermen were published
in the <i>Public Advertiser</i> of the 28th November, and
were severely commented upon, whilst the action of
Wilkes was highly approved of. "The spirit of
injustice and violence which influenced the proceedings
of the Court of Aldermen on Tuesday"&mdash;it
was reported&mdash;"predominated stronger on Friday by
the arrival of Mr. Harley. One of the candidates for
the vacant aldermanship of Bridge Within, William
Neate, Esq., was refused to be heard, and likewise
his agent, Mr. John Reynolds. Mr. Houston, the
attorney who officiated at the wardmote, was not
suffered to make his report of the election. Mr.
Alderman Kirkman acquainted the Court that he
had been served with a <i>mandamus</i> from the Court
of King's Bench to swear in Mr. Neate, but no
attention was paid to him. Mr. Townshend and
Mr. Oliver insisted on the swearing in of Mr. Hart
immediately, and Mr. Harley's natural violence and
rage were brought in aid to the intemperate and
unjust spirit of the other two aldermen. The lord
mayor, however, had too much firmness to yield to
an act of palpable partiality and injustice, and
prevented the disgrace, which otherwise that Court
would have received, by repeatedly refusing to put
the question."<a name="FNanchor_377" id="FNanchor_377"></a><a href="#Footnote_377" class="fnanchor">[377]</a> The whole passage reads very
much as if inspired by Wilkes himself; but whether
this were so or not, Wilkes entered his protest against
a resolution of the Court that the paragraph was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>injurious to the honour of the Court and "not founded
in truth," because he apprehended that it <i>was</i> "founded
in truth."</p>

<div class="sidenote">Refusal by
Wilkes to put
a question
reflecting
upon himself,
29 Nov., 1774.</div>

<p>Before the aldermen again met (29 Nov.) the
city solicitor, acting (apparently) upon instructions
from Wilkes, had defended Hart's <i>mandamus</i>, and
at the next Court that officer was severely questioned
on the matter, and was told that the Court would
not allow him his costs. A motion was at the
same time made to the effect that the lord mayor
having refused to put a question which the Court of
Aldermen was competent to decide, had violated the
right of election in the freemen of the city, as represented
in that Court. It was, of course, the business
of Wilkes to put this question, but unlike Trevor, the
Speaker, who stultified himself before the House of
Commons in 1695, Wilkes positively declined, telling
his brother aldermen that he thanked God he was
"not quite idiot enough" for that.<a name="FNanchor_378" id="FNanchor_378"></a><a href="#Footnote_378" class="fnanchor">[378]</a> A week later
(6 Dec.) the Court passed a resolution to the effect
that Neate had not been duly elected, and Wilkes
again protested. The Court thereupon proposed
to swear in Hart, but Wilkes again refused to
put the question for the reason that the parties
had not been heard.<a name="FNanchor_379" id="FNanchor_379"></a><a href="#Footnote_379" class="fnanchor">[379]</a> Matters were thus brought
to a deadlock. At length&mdash;on the 17th January,
1775&mdash;the Court put itself in order by hearing
Neate, and immediately afterwards passed a resolution
for calling in and swearing Hart. Wilkes no
longer raised any objection, and Hart was sworn.<a name="FNanchor_380" id="FNanchor_380"></a><a href="#Footnote_380" class="fnanchor">[380]</a>
Hart did not long enjoy his victory, for by a judgment
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>of the King's Bench, pronounced in Easter term, 1776,
he was excluded from intermeddling with the aldermanry,
and on the 18th June Thomas Wooldridge
(<i>not</i> Neate) was admitted in his place.<a name="FNanchor_381" id="FNanchor_381"></a><a href="#Footnote_381" class="fnanchor">[381]</a> As between
Wilkes and the Court of Aldermen the honours
certainly lay with the former, and he did not hesitate
to tell the Court that he intended to pursue the same
line of conduct throughout his year of office in spite
of all the Court might think or do;&mdash;"I declared that
I never would put a question to decide the merits of
a cause before this Court until both the parties had
been heard. The Court at last consented that Mr.
Neate should be heard, and only after he had been
heard did I put the question.... The same
line of truth and impartiality I will steadily pursue
thro' the whole course of my mayoralty, regardless
of any resolutions of this Court which are repugnant
to the great principles of justice or the fair rights of
the chief magistrate."<a name="FNanchor_382" id="FNanchor_382"></a><a href="#Footnote_382" class="fnanchor">[382]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">The new
Parliament
and the
American
colonies, 1775.</div>

<p>The result of the recent general election proved
to be in favour of the ministry, and distinctly anti-American.
The nation had declared for war, and
nothing that the City could do was of any avail to
prevent it. As soon as Parliament met (19 Jan.,
1775) Chatham went down to the Lords and urged
the advisability of addressing the king for the removal
of the troops from Boston as a conciliatory measure.
He was determined, he said, not to let the matter
rest, but would labour to bring the country to a sense
of the impending danger:&mdash;"I wish, my lords, not to
lose a day in this urgent, pressing crisis; an hour
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>now lost in allaying ferments in America may
produce years of calamity; for my own part, I will
not desert, for a moment, the conduct of this
weighty business from the first to the last, unless
nailed to my bed by the extremity of sickness. I
will give it unremitted attention; I will knock at
the door of this sleeping and confounded ministry,
and will rouse them to a sense of their impending
danger."<a name="FNanchor_383" id="FNanchor_383"></a><a href="#Footnote_383" class="fnanchor">[383]</a> The citizens of London were among the
few who supported Chatham at this momentous crisis
in the country's history, and they despatched the
Town Clerk to the earl's country seat with an address
of thanks, which was acknowledged in very flattering
terms.<a name="FNanchor_384" id="FNanchor_384"></a><a href="#Footnote_384" class="fnanchor">[384]</a> So far from showing any disposition to conciliate
the colonies by withdrawing troops and repealing
obnoxious Acts, the new House proceeded to consider
a Bill for cutting off the inhabitants of Massachusetts
and other parts from the Newfoundland fishery. To
this the Common Council at once entered their protest,
both before the Lords and Commons. It was not to
be supposed, they plainly told Parliament, that a great
number of men, naturally hardy and brave, would
quietly submit to a law which would reduce them to
the verge of famine.<a name="FNanchor_385" id="FNanchor_385"></a><a href="#Footnote_385" class="fnanchor">[385]</a> The warning was to no purpose.
The Bill passed.<a name="FNanchor_386" id="FNanchor_386"></a><a href="#Footnote_386" class="fnanchor">[386]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Remonstrance
of livery,
5 April, 1775.</div>

<p>At length matters looked so serious that the
livery of London met in Common Hall on the 5th
April and drew up a respectful but solemn warning to
the king himself against the fatal policy pursued by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>his ministers towards America. The measures which
the government had recently adopted were declared
to be "big with all consequences which can alarm a
free and commercial people." They inflicted (said the
livery) a deep and perhaps fatal wound to commerce;
they ruined manufactures; they reduced the revenue
and increased the taxes; and they alienated the
colonists. Here, as ever, commercial interests were
placed by the citizens in the foreground. But commercial
interests did not form the sole motive for this
remonstrance. The City's own liberties were at stake
if the liberties of the subject in any part of the
kingdom were infringed;&mdash;"Your petitioners conceive
the liberties of the whole to be inevitably
connected with those of every part of an empire,
founded on the common rights of mankind. They cannot,
therefore, observe without the greatest concern
and alarm the constitution fundamentally violated
in any part of your majesty's dominions. They
esteem it an essential, unalterable principle of liberty,
the source and security of all constitutional rights
that no part of the dominion can be taxed without
being represented."<a name="FNanchor_387" id="FNanchor_387"></a><a href="#Footnote_387" class="fnanchor">[387]</a> The livery resolved that this
address or remonstrance should be presented by the
lord mayor, the city members, the Court of Aldermen
(<i>not</i> the Common Council) and the sheriffs, and that
they themselves should also attend the presentation
in a body (and not by deputation, as in 1771 and 1773).
Having settled this business, they next proceeded
to pass votes of thanks to the Lords and Commons<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
who had opposed "the impolitic and inhuman Bill for
prohibiting the people of New England from the
Newfoundland fishery, and for their opposition to
other arbitrary, cruel and anti-commercial measures"
against their fellow subjects in America. They also
thanked Chatham and Burke for the plan they had
proposed for conciliating the American colonies; and
lastly, they passed a vote of thanks to such of the
Commons as had recently voted on Wilkes's oft
repeated motion for expunging the resolutions of the
late Parliament respecting Wilkes and the Middlesex
election.<a name="FNanchor_388" id="FNanchor_388"></a><a href="#Footnote_388" class="fnanchor">[388]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">The King's
reply,
10 April,
1775.</div>

<p>Notwithstanding the absence of the Common
Council and the inordinate number of the livery that
had expressed their intention of being present, the
king submitted, rather than risk a contest with the
City with Wilkes in the mayoralty chair. With
Wilkes's personal behaviour at court the king was
agreeably surprised, and owned that he had never
seen "so well-bred a lord mayor."<a name="FNanchor_389" id="FNanchor_389"></a><a href="#Footnote_389" class="fnanchor">[389]</a> The conduct of
the mayor, however, took nothing off the asperity of
the king's reply. He expressed the "utmost astonishment"
that any of his subjects should be capable of
encouraging the rebellious spirit which had displayed
itself in some of the colonies in North America. As
to the Parliament, which the livery had recently
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>characterised as a "formidable instrument of arbitrary
power," instead of being the guardian of liberty, he
declared that he had every confidence in it and intended
to carry out its measures.</p>

<p>The next day (11 April) the Earl of Hertford,

command, giving him notice that in future his majesty
would not receive on the throne any address, remonstrance
or petition except from the body corporate
of the City.</p>

of Common Halls and the powers and rights of the
livery, in which he refers Lord Hertford to the opinions
of counsel delivered in 1771 and 1773.<a name="FNanchor_391" id="FNanchor_391"></a><a href="#Footnote_391" class="fnanchor">[391]</a> He reminds
his lordship that the claim which he was making on
behalf of the livery of London to the right of presenting
addresses to the king on his throne was of no little
importance, and not to be lightly abandoned or set
aside;&mdash;"When his majesty receives on the throne any
address it is read by the proper officer to the king
in the presence of the petitioners. They have the
satisfaction of knowing that their sovereign has heard
their complaints. They receive an answer. If the
same address is presented at a lev&eacute;e, or in any other
mode, no answer is given. A suspicion may arise
that the address is never heard or read, because it is
only received, and immediately delivered to the
lord in waiting." It was on the throne (the letter
continued) that the king and his predecessors had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>constantly received addresses of the livery, and "on
the most exact research" not a single instance had
been found to the contrary. Wilkes concluded by
expressing his fears lest the unfavourable answer the
king had returned to the remonstrance should be
considered by the American colonies as a fresh mark
of the king's anger towards them, as well as of his
displeasure against the faithful citizens of London.
The livery would comfort themselves with the
assurance of the king's sense of justice, which would
sooner or later restore them to royal favour; but the
Americans might be driven to despair unless by the
merciful interposition of Providence the hearts of
ministers were turned. Wilkes took care that his
letter received the necessary publicity.<a name="FNanchor_392" id="FNanchor_392"></a><a href="#Footnote_392" class="fnanchor">[392]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Appeal from
New York to
the City,
5 May, 1775.</div>

<p>The warning came too late; open hostilities had
already commenced. The attitude of the colonies
towards the mother-country was clearly defined in a
letter addressed to the City of London by the committee
of Association of New York on the 5th May.<a name="FNanchor_393" id="FNanchor_393"></a><a href="#Footnote_393" class="fnanchor">[393]</a>
All the horrors of a civil war, the letter protested,
would never compel America to submit to taxation
by authority of Parliament, although it was perfectly
ready to make voluntary contributions "as Englishmen"
to assist the king if properly requisitioned.
The writers appealed to the City of London, well
knowing its attachment to the cause of justice and
liberty, and they concluded their letter with an
expression of confidence that it would use its utmost
exertions "to restore union, mutual confidence and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>peace to the whole empire." The letter was laid
before the Common Council on Friday, the 23rd June,

<div class="sidenote">Proceedings
of Common
Hall, 24 June,
1775.</div>

<p>The next day being Midsummer-day the livery
met as usual in Common Hall for the purpose of
electing sheriffs and other officers. Alderman Hayley,
the brother-in-law of Wilkes, was one of the sheriffs
elected and Alderman Newnham the other. The
ordinary business of the day having been got through
Wilkes formally reported to the Common Hall the
king's reply to the last address of the livery, and
next proceeded to lay before them Lord Hertford's
letter and his own reply. These having been read
the Town Clerk was ordered to enter both letters in
the City's Records, and a vote of thanks was passed
to Wilkes "for his very able, judicious and spirited
defence of the rights and privileges of the livery."
The livery next proceeded to pass a resolution
condemning the conduct of those ministers who had
advised the king not to receive in future on the throne
any address, remonstrance or petition from the livery
of London, as being subversive of the right of the
subject to petition the throne, and as calculated to
alienate the minds of Englishmen from the Hanoverian
succession. Then turning from their own grievances
to those of America they passed a vote of thanks to
the Earl of Effingham for his courageous conduct
in throwing up his commission in the army rather
than draw his sword against the lives and liberties
of his fellow subjects, and next proceeded to prepare<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>
another remonstrance to the king on the American
war.<a name="FNanchor_395" id="FNanchor_395"></a><a href="#Footnote_395" class="fnanchor">[395]</a></p>

<p>This new remonstrance was, if possible, stronger
and more plain spoken than any yet presented.
The king was told that the power which he and
his ministers claimed to exercise over the colonies,
under the specious name of "dignity," was nothing
less than "despotism," and that as the livery of
London would not suffer any man, or any body of
men, to establish arbitrary power over themselves,
so they would not acquiesce in an attempt to
force it upon any of their fellow subjects. They did
not hesitate to declare that the majority of the
members of that Parliament, in which the king had
recently avowed he placed entire confidence, were
"notoriously bribed to betray their constituents and
their country."<a name="FNanchor_396" id="FNanchor_396"></a><a href="#Footnote_396" class="fnanchor">[396]</a> Notwithstanding Lord Hertford's
recent letter, they insisted upon the king receiving
their address upon the throne, and intimated their
intention of attending the presentation in a body.
This was more than the king could stand, and he
determined to put his foot down. The address not
being an address of the Corporation of London, he
expressed his intention of receiving it at his next lev&eacute;e,
and when objection was raised by the sheriffs to this
course, he told them that he was judge where to
receive it.<a name="FNanchor_397" id="FNanchor_397"></a><a href="#Footnote_397" class="fnanchor">[397]</a> This decision being reported to the livery
they resolved (4 July) to publish their remonstrance,
and not to present it. They at the same time passed
a number of resolutions condemning the king's
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>advisers, and ordered the sheriffs to place in the
king's own hands a copy of these resolutions as well
as of those passed on Midsummer-day, signed by the

<p>On Friday, the 7th July, the Common Council
took into consideration the letter from New York,
which had been read to the Court on the 23rd June,
and which had by this time been printed and circulated
among the members of the Council, as ordered. A
motion was thereupon made that a humble address
and petition should be presented from the Court to
his majesty praying him to suspend hostilities in
America, and adopt such conciliatory measures as
might restore union, confidence and peace to the

was in due course read and approved.<a name="FNanchor_399" id="FNanchor_399"></a><a href="#Footnote_399" class="fnanchor">[399]</a> It is clear

<div class="sidenote">Address of
the livery to
electors of
Great Britain,
29 Sept., 1775.</div>

<p>On Michaelmas-day, when his successor in the
mayoralty chair was chosen by the livery, Wilkes,
who had recently refused to countenance by his
presence the proclamation of the Americans as rebels
(23 Aug.),<a name="FNanchor_403" id="FNanchor_403"></a><a href="#Footnote_403" class="fnanchor">[403]</a> produced a letter he had received from
the Congress at Philadelphia appealing to the city of
London, as the "patron of liberty," to mediate for
the restoration of peace. Thereupon an address to
the electors of Great Britain (prepared at a previous
meeting of the livery held at the Half Moon tavern
in Cheapside) calling upon them to assist the livery
to bring to justice the authors of the evils that had
arisen in this country and America was also produced
and read. The document pointed to the increase of
national debt and the decrease of national resources
that must supervene if a ruinous and expensive war
was to be undertaken against the American colonies.
What was the object of the war? It could not be
the security of England's commerce, for that was not
in danger; neither could it be to bring the colonies
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>into due subordination to the mother-country, for the
colonies themselves had repeatedly and solemnly
acknowledged their subordination and submission to
England. It appeared, then, that the object of the
war was nothing else than to establish the arbitrary
power of the crown over their fellow subjects in
America&mdash;a measure which would greatly endanger
the constitution at home and increase the number of
placemen and pensioners. All that the colonies asked
for was peace, liberty and safety. They had pledged
themselves to be ready and willing in time of war to
show their loyalty to the king and to assist him with
money and men to the utmost of their ability. What
more could in justice be required? They had recently
made a final appeal in the hope that the effusion of
blood might be stayed, but to this appeal no answer
had been vouchsafed. "This, gentlemen," the address
continued, "is the alarming state of America, which
fills us with anxiety and apprehensions. We lament
the blood that has been already shed; we deplore
the fate of those brave men who are devoted to
hazard their lives&mdash;not against the enemies of the
British name, but against the friends of the prosperity
and glory of Great Britain; we feel for the honour
of the British arms, sullied&mdash;not by the misbehaviour
of those who bore them, but by the misconduct of
the ministers who employed them to the oppression
of their fellow subjects; we are alarmed at the
immediate, insupportable expense and the probable
consequences of a war which, we are convinced,
originates in violence and injustice, and must end
in ruin. These are the sentiments, gentlemen,"
concluded this impassionate address, "which we take<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>
the liberty of communicating to you as the reasons
upon which we have acted; trusting that if they
meet with your approbation you will co-operate with
us in endeavouring to bring the authors of those evils
to the justice of their country." This "decent but
very strong address," as Walpole called it,<a name="FNanchor_404" id="FNanchor_404"></a><a href="#Footnote_404" class="fnanchor">[404]</a> was at
once adopted as "the address of the lord mayor,

Sayre, an

Oct., 1775.</div>

<p>The tension of men's minds at this crisis was so
great that all kinds of rumours gained credit, and a
certain comical element was introduced in the midst of
the prevailing gloom. A young American officer named
Richardson, who was confined in the Tower, solemnly
declared on oath that Stephen Sayre, an ex-sheriff of
London, had paid him a visit and privately offered
him a large sum of money to assist in seizing the
Tower. This was only a part of the conspiracy.
The king himself was to be seized on his way to the
House of Lords and forced to call a new Parliament.
Everybody, except the ministers, laughed at the folly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>of such a charge. A council was summoned, and by
order of the Earl of Rochfort, secretary of state, Sayre
was arrested and&mdash;in compliment to the City, so it was
said&mdash;committed to the Tower. He was, however,
shortly released.<a name="FNanchor_407" id="FNanchor_407"></a><a href="#Footnote_407" class="fnanchor">[407]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Proceedings of
Parliament,
Oct.-Nov.,
1775.</div>

<p>Parliament met on the 26th without any disturbance,
and the king in his address showed a
determination to prosecute the war with vigour.
Sawbridge, who had been elected successor to Wilkes
in the mayoralty chair, took occasion to compare
the conduct of Lord Effingham with that of Lord
George Germaine, formerly Lord Sackville, who had
behaved so discreditably at the battle of Minden
in 1759, and who had recently accepted office
under the ministry. The one had thrown up his
commission rather than engage in civil war, whilst
the other "had turned pale at the head of squadrons."<a name="FNanchor_408" id="FNanchor_408"></a><a href="#Footnote_408" class="fnanchor">[408]</a>
In the last week of November, Alderman Oliver,
in accordance with a resolution of the livery of
London of the 4th July, moved the House to address
his majesty, that he might be pleased to inform the
Commons who were the advisers of the several
measures so obnoxious to the American Colonies.
The motion, however, found but little support except
from Wilkes and Sawbridge, and upon being pressed
to a division, was lost by an overwhelming majority.<a name="FNanchor_409" id="FNanchor_409"></a><a href="#Footnote_409" class="fnanchor">[409]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Expenses
of Wilkes's
mayoralty.</div>

<p>At the close of Wilkes's mayoralty he received
the thanks of the City for the splendour and hospitality
that had marked his year of office, as well as for "his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>vigilant and steady attachment to, and his very able
vindication of the constitutional rights of his fellow
subjects."<a name="FNanchor_410" id="FNanchor_410"></a><a href="#Footnote_410" class="fnanchor">[410]</a> It would never have done for one who
had so severely taken Trecothick to task for failing
to maintain the City's reputation for hospitality, to
have himself been deficient in that respect, whilst
occupying the mayoralty chair; but setting this aside,
Wilkes was naturally prone to lavish expenditure
whether in or out of office. The result was that the
close of his mayoralty found him in serious pecuniary
difficulties. The lord mayors of that day derived
their income from various sources, among them, being
the sale of those places under the Corporation which
happened to fall vacant during their year of office.<a name="FNanchor_411" id="FNanchor_411"></a><a href="#Footnote_411" class="fnanchor">[411]</a>
No two mayors therefore enjoyed precisely the same
income, whilst their expenditure was then, as now,
only limited by their individual tastes, or the length
of their private purses. Wilkes's receipts during his
year of office had amounted to &pound;4,889 o<i>s.</i> 6&frac12;<i>d.</i>,
whereas his expenditure had been no less than
&pound;8,226 13<i>s.</i><a name="FNanchor_412" id="FNanchor_412"></a><a href="#Footnote_412" class="fnanchor">[412]</a> He was therefore out of pocket to
the amount of nearly &pound;3,500, or perhaps we ought
rather to say that he would have been out of pocket
to that extent, had he actually disbursed the money.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>This he had not done, for the simple reason that he
had none to disburse.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Wilkes a
candidate for
the Chamberlainship,
1776-1778.</div>

<p>His impecuniosity led him to consider seriously
the advisability of becoming a candidate for one or
other of the more lucrative posts in the gift of the
citizens. Hitherto he had been averse to taking such
a course, but matters had now come to such a pass
that when the Chamberlainship of the City happened
to fall vacant in February, 1776, through the resignation
of Sir Stephen Janssen, he followed the advice
of his friends, and became a candidate for the post.
He was unsuccessful, however, being defeated by
Benjamin Hopkins, a brother alderman. This being
an <i>interim</i> election, Hopkins had again to seek the
suffrages of the livery at Midsummer. Wilkes again
opposed him, and was again defeated; this time by a
crushing majority. Here it would have been well
if he had rested satisfied, and not offered any
further opposition when his more successful rival
offered himself annually for re-election, the appointment
being virtually during good behaviour. He was
not, however, a man to let any scruples of delicacy
stand in his way, and, moreover, he was being
sorely pressed by creditors. Accordingly, he offered
himself as a candidate, in opposition to Hopkins,
at Midsummer, 1777, and again in 1778, but on both
occasions he was defeated.<a name="FNanchor_413" id="FNanchor_413"></a><a href="#Footnote_413" class="fnanchor">[413]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">His creditors

<p>In the meantime his creditors had again and

beyond a cool assurance that he had expended the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>
whole of the allowance made him by the City in
executing the duties of the mayoralty; that their
claims exceeded this allowance and he could not
therefore discharge them! Was ever impertinence
more sublime? Any other man they would have
had laid by the heels, without further ado, but
Wilkes they feared to touch. After much patience
and long suffering, they made so bold as to appeal to
the Common Council. This was in October, 1777.
Someone suggested the bestowal of an annuity of
&pound;500 upon Wilkes for his public services, but the
City wisely decided that the granting of any annuity
to him, or the payment of his debts whether contracted
in or out of office, would establish a bad
precedent.<a name="FNanchor_414" id="FNanchor_414"></a><a href="#Footnote_414" class="fnanchor">[414]</a></p>

Wilkes had at last seen the futility of continuing the
struggle. Possibly the state of Hopkins's health may
have had something to do with Wilkes's withdrawal.
This, however, is only conjecture. All that we know

<p>Early in 1776 England and America were startled
by the appearance of a small treatise entitled "Observations
on the nature of civil liberty, the principles
of government and the justice and policy of the war
in America." The writer was Dr. Richard Price, a
Dissenting minister, who had devoted much of his
leisure to the consideration of questions of public
interest, and more especially finance. The demand
for his latest work was so great that it outran the
supply. The Freedom of the City in a gold box was

was, however, declined on the score of old age.</p>

<div class="sidenote">City address

<p>The day that the Common Council voted Dr.
Price the Freedom of the City (14 March, 1776) it
resolved once more to address the king with the view,
if possible, of obtaining the postponement of any
further military operations until America had had an
opportunity of definitely refusing such just and
honourable terms as this country was willing to offer.
If this were done, England would free herself of any
taint or suspicion of injustice and oppression, whilst
the refusal of the colonies would then become rebellion.
The king's reply was brief. He avoided giving a direct
answer to the City's proposal, but contented himself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
with expressing his deep concern at the misery which
the colonies had brought upon themselves, and his
readiness to extend mercy and clemency as soon as the
"existing rebellion was at an end."<a name="FNanchor_418" id="FNanchor_418"></a><a href="#Footnote_418" class="fnanchor">[418]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Declaration of

<p>The king's answer shows how little he was
acquainted with the real feeling of the colonists at
this time. With them it was no longer a question of
clemency or redress. The idea of a total separation
from the mother-country had already taken shape.
France had shown a disposition to assist them, and
thus avenge herself on England for the Seven Years'
war; but with or without France the colonies were
bent on separation, and on the 4th July the Declaration
of Independence was signed.</p>

with great cruelty, and met with much opposition.
When Parliament met on the last day of October,
Wilkes took the opportunity of an amendment being
moved to the address to inveigh against press warrants,
as well as against the "savage and piratical, as well as
unjust, war" into which the country had been plunged
by the king's ministers. He told the House that the
press-gangs did not dare enter the City, knowing full
well the character of Sawbridge, the lord mayor.<a name="FNanchor_419" id="FNanchor_419"></a><a href="#Footnote_419" class="fnanchor">[419]</a> "It is

13 March,
1778.</div>

<p>The fears entertained by the citizens were well
founded. On the very day that their address was
presented, the French ambassador delivered to Lord
Weymouth a declaration that the king of France had
entered into a treaty of commerce and amity with
the Independent States of America, and that any
attempt to interfere with that commerce between
those two countries would be resented by his master.
A few days later Benjamin Franklin was formally
received at Versailles as ambassador for the United
States of America.<a name="FNanchor_427" id="FNanchor_427"></a><a href="#Footnote_427" class="fnanchor">[427]</a> In the face of this new danger,
both Houses rallied round the throne, with vows of
support in maintaining the honour and dignity of the
crown and nation, although in both Houses there
were not wanting those who were in favour of
petitioning the king for the removal of those
ministers who had brought about all the mischief.
The insulting message sent by France touching
interruption of commerce with America, had in fact
rather strengthened the ministry than otherwise, and
a proposal in the Court of Aldermen to summon a
Common Hall for the purpose of agitating for their
removal fell flat.<a name="FNanchor_428" id="FNanchor_428"></a><a href="#Footnote_428" class="fnanchor">[428]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">The death of
Chatham,
11 May, 1778.</div>

<p>Chatham now became one of the foremost
advocates for the maintenance of the supremacy of
Great Britain over its dependencies, however opposed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>he had been to the fatal policy that brought the
country to such a crisis; and it was to him that
Lord North, who had long wished to withdraw from
the ministry, advised the king to apply for aid. Even
if the king had been willing to trust Chatham, which
he was not, the state of the Earl's health would
scarcely have allowed him to accept a position of
such responsibility. His days were in fact numbered.
On Tuesday, the 7th April, he unexpectedly appeared
in the House of Lords, having risen from a sick bed
with the sole object of opposing a motion of the
Duke of Richmond, virtually conceding the independence
of the American Colonies. When the
Duke had finished his speech, Chatham, slowly and
with difficulty, rose from his seat. In words that at
first were scarcely audible he explained that ill-health
had prevented him from attending, at so important a
crisis, to his parliamentary duties. He had that day
made an effort, almost beyond his strength, to attend
the House where, perhaps he might never speak
again, and to express his indignation at the suggestion
that had been made of yielding up the sovereignty of
America. "My lords," he said, "I rejoice that the grave
has not closed upon me: that I am still alive to lift up
my voice against the dismemberment of the ancient
and most noble monarchy," and he concluded a
spirited and affecting speech by exhorting his
countrymen to make an effort to maintain their
supremacy [that supremacy to which he himself
had contributed so much] and, if they fell, to fall
like men.<a name="FNanchor_429" id="FNanchor_429"></a><a href="#Footnote_429" class="fnanchor">[429]</a> Even as he spoke, his words began to
falter, and on rising to make a second speech, he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>
staggered and fell back in a fit of apoplexy. To all
appearance he was in a dying state. He rallied
however, but only for a few weeks, and on the
11th May he died.</p>

<div class="sidenote">His funeral,
9 June, 1778.</div>

<p>The City lost no time in petitioning Parliament
that the remains of the statesman "whose vigour and
counsels had so much contributed to the protection
and extension of its commerce," might rest in
St. Paul's, and the Lord Chamberlain was asked to
give timely notice of the funeral in order that the
Common Council might pay their last token of
respect. The Chamberlain promised to accede to this
request, but the City's petition to Parliament met with
no further notice than an order that it should lie on the
table.<a name="FNanchor_430" id="FNanchor_430"></a><a href="#Footnote_430" class="fnanchor">[430]</a> Having failed in this direction the City determined
to approach the king himself on the subject, and
a "remarkably decent and respectful" address was
prepared for the purpose in the Common Council.<a name="FNanchor_431" id="FNanchor_431"></a><a href="#Footnote_431" class="fnanchor">[431]</a>
Unfortunately the City had incurred the king's displeasure
not only on account of its recent addresses,
but also for the respect and affection it had always
entertained towards Chatham, who for years had been
the object of his special aversion. When asked to
name a day for the reception of the address, the first
question was as to its nature. He was afraid of having
to listen to more "stuff." His curiosity, however, on
the point was not gratified. The sheriff (Clarke)
respectfully declined to inform him of the nature of
the address, and for his "prudent conduct" was
rewarded with the thanks of the Common Council.<a name="FNanchor_432" id="FNanchor_432"></a><a href="#Footnote_432" class="fnanchor">[432]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span></p>

<p>At length Friday, the 5th June, was appointed for
receiving the address. By that time arrangements
had been made for the interment to take place in
Westminster Abbey, and the king notified the citizens
of the fact in a somewhat dry and ungracious manner.<a name="FNanchor_433" id="FNanchor_433"></a><a href="#Footnote_433" class="fnanchor">[433]</a>
Although the ceremony was fixed for the 9th no
notice had been sent to the City, notwithstanding the
Lord Chamberlain's promise. The Common Council
therefore, finding themselves thus trifled with, rescinded
their resolution to attend.<a name="FNanchor_434" id="FNanchor_434"></a><a href="#Footnote_434" class="fnanchor">[434]</a> Indeed the attitude taken
up by the king and his ministers throughout the whole
business was singularly childish and undignified.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The City's
monument to
Chatham.</div>

<p>The citizens, on the other hand, though prevented
from showing their respect at the grave-side of the
deceased statesman, were resolved to erect a memorial
to one who, when in power, had never (as they declared)
allowed them to return from the throne dissatisfied.
A sculptured monument by Bacon, with an inscription
from the pen of the great Edmund Burke, was in
due course erected in the Guildhall, for the express
purpose that citizens might "never meet for the transaction
of their affairs without being reminded that
the means by which Providence raises a nation to
greatness are the virtues infused into great men;
and that to withhold from those virtues, either of
the living or the dead, the tribute of esteem and
veneration, is to deny themselves the means of
happiness and honour."</p>

<div class="sidenote">Court martial
of Admiral
Keppel,
Jan., 1779.</div>

<p>The extension of the sphere of war owing to
the French alliance with America brought great
difficulties to the ministry. A powerful fleet under
Keppel was sent into the Channel, and in July
engaged the French fleet off Ushant, but the action
was indecisive, and both fleets retired, the one to
Brest, and the other to Plymouth. Keppel had
signalled Sir Hugh Palliser, his second in command,
to bear up with his squadron, and renew the action,
but Palliser's ship was much crippled, and he was
either unable or unwilling to comply. Mutual
recriminations followed, and as both admirals were
in Parliament and political adversaries, Keppel being
in Opposition, whilst Palliser was a Lord of the
Admiralty, the charges led to a fierce Parliamentary
war, and eventually Keppel had to submit to a court
martial. The trial took place at Portsmouth, and
lasted over a month. The result was anxiously
awaited by the City and the country. At length,
late in the evening of the 11th February (1779), a
courier brought the news that Keppel had been
honourably acquitted. The whole of London was
at once one blaze of illuminations. Palliser had to
make his escape out of Portsmouth for fear of
violence, and a house in Pall Mall once occupied
by him was completely gutted by the mob and its
contents burnt in St. James's Square. The gates
of the Admiralty were taken off their hinges. Lord<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>
Sandwich had his windows smashed, so had Lord
North, and greater damage would have been done
but for the interference of the military.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Vote of thanks
and Freedom
of City to
Keppel,

<p>The next day (12 Feb.) the Common Council
passed a vote of thanks to Keppel "for his spirited
behaviour on the 27th of July last in his attack on
the French fleet, for his glorious and gallant efforts
to renew the engagement in the afternoon of that

rendered it worse by allying herself (June, 1779) with
France and America against Great Britain. North
had again and again intimated his readiness to resign,
but the king would not hear of it, and the minister
yielded to his master's stronger will and consented to
remain in office against his own convictions. With
this increase of danger Parliament again rallied round
the throne, and voted loyal addresses. At the same
time the leading Whig lords protested against the

was increasing dissatisfaction at the national expenditure

over Parliament. The Opposition took advantage of
this feeling, and in December motions were brought
before the House of Lords in favour of economical
reform. These were rejected, and the further consideration
of the matter was postponed until the
8th February (1780). The Common Council sympathised
with the Dukes of Devonshire, Grafton,
Manchester, Portland and other Whig lords in their
endeavours to promote reform, and passed them a
vote of thanks. The Corporation was convinced
that the cause of all the existing trouble lay in the
"enormous and undue influence of the crown," and
promised them support. Each of the lords wrote to

7 April, 1780.</div>

<p>As time went on the Committees of Association,
not content with their legitimate work&mdash;the work
for which they were originally established&mdash;viz.,
economical reform, took upon themselves to push
parliamentary reform, a matter on which the country
was not as yet agreed. The City approved of their
action, having long been anxious to see a recurrence
to short parliaments and a change made in the mode
of representation, but in other places the new departure
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>caused alarm. In Wiltshire, Lord Shelburne's county,
the Association had been disavowed<a name="FNanchor_449" id="FNanchor_449"></a><a href="#Footnote_449" class="fnanchor">[449]</a> owing to its
recent action, and his lordship had in consequence
written a letter to the county upholding the Association.
Soon after this Shelburne was wounded in
a duel, and upon his recovery the City took the
opportunity of sending him a letter of congratulation,
and at the same time of testifying their appreciation
of his letter to the county of Wilts;&mdash;"The noble and
manly proof which your lordship has given in your
letter to the county of Wilts of your decided
concurrence in the undoubted right of the people to
short parliaments and the necessity of a more equal
representation cannot but increase our regard,

<p>The earl in reply assured the Common Council

as the strongest preservative against despondency.
As regards the proposals for shortening the duration
of parliaments and a more equitable representation,
which the counties, cities and boroughs of England
were combining to obtain, they would certainly meet
his zealous concurrence whenever they should appear
"to be the public sense." Without wishing to influence

shortening the duration of parliaments, and (3) of
establishing greater equality in parliamentary representation
by allowing the several counties of Great
Britain to elect in a due proportion 100 members at
least in addition to their present number. The
Common Council at once approved of the form, and
ordered the Town Clerk to subscribe to it in the
name of the Corporation. The citizens were to be
recommended also to subscribe to it as being the best
plan for effecting the objects in view. The Court at
the same time deemed it opportune to place on record
the passage in Chatham's letter to Lord Temple of

<p>Scarcely had the ministry managed to escape from

new danger. This time they did not stand alone;
the strife of parties ceased in the presence of a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>common danger. For some time past an agitation
had been set on foot against a Bill which Sir George
Savile had carried in 1778, for the relief of Catholics
from some of the hardships inflicted upon them by
law. The cry of "No Popery" had been raised, and
in March last a motion had been made in the Common
Council against any proceedings in Parliament calculated
to favour Papists. The consideration of the
motion was adjourned, and did not come on again
until the 31st May, when the court came to a
resolution that the passing of any Acts of Parliament
in favour of Papists, or the repealing of any Acts
against Popery, was repugnant to the true interests
of the country. It, at the same time, directed the
City's representatives in Parliament to support any
movement for the repeal of Savile's Act, so far as
it related "to the establishment of seminaries for the
education of youth, and the purchasing of lands
within the realm."<a name="FNanchor_454" id="FNanchor_454"></a><a href="#Footnote_454" class="fnanchor">[454]</a> Protestant associations were

petition which he desired to lay before the House of

took place on Friday, the 2nd June. Whilst Lord

foot guards. Foiled in their attempt to intimidate

and proceeded to sack and burn the Roman Catholic
chapels attached to the Sardinian and Bavarian
embassies, standing in Duke Street, Lincoln's Inn

<div class="sidenote">Riot in
Moorfields,
4 and 5 June,
1780.</div>

<p>Matters were not allowed to rest here. On
Saturday afternoon (3 June), Kennet, the lord mayor,
received a letter from Lord Stormont, secretary of
state, forewarning him of the likelihood of tumults
arising within his jurisdiction and strongly recommending
him to take the necessary steps for
preserving the peace. The day passed off quietly,
however. A few people gathered in Ropemakers
Alley, Little Moorfields, where stood a Roman
Catholic chapel, but no disturbance took place. On
Sunday afternoon (4 June) matters took a turn for
the worse, and the mayor, being informed that a very
great concourse of people had assembled in Moorfields
in a riotous manner, and was threatening the
chapel, at once sent for the marshals and their
men and instructed them to procure as many
constables as possible, and disperse the mob. In
the evening the mayor himself went to the scene
of riot, and stayed there until three o'clock in the
morning. In the course of the night he received
another and more urgent letter from Lord Stormont;&mdash;"I
cannot but hope, and trust from your lordship's
known zeal and activity that every effectual legal
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span>method will be used by you to preserve the public
peace by guarding it against those dangers to which
it stands exposed." The mayor was quick to grasp
the situation. There were not nearly sufficient
constables procurable to put down the riot, and those
that were present declined to exert themselves to
save the property of Roman Catholics. Kennet
therefore took the only course open to him, and
sent to the Tower for military assistance. The
commander, however, was slow to give the aid
required, and could be prevailed upon to send no
more than 73 men, all told, and even these were
sent in detachments. The force was utterly inadequate
to cope with the crowd, but fortunately
the mob were by this time ready to listen to the
appeals of the mayor and aldermen, and quiet was
at length restored. The mayor went home to seek a
much needed rest, leaving one of the sheriffs on the
spot in case of emergency. On Monday morning
(5 June) a fresh riot broke out, and the mayor sent
again to the Tower. A detachment of horse and
foot was despatched to his assistance, but by the
time it arrived the chapel and several houses adjoining
had been burnt and destroyed.<a name="FNanchor_456" id="FNanchor_456"></a><a href="#Footnote_456" class="fnanchor">[456]</a> The principal
object of attack outside the city was Savile House
in Leicester Fields, the house of Sir George Savile
himself, the indirect author of all the mischief, and
this was sacked by the mob.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The conduct

<p>Upon hearing of this fresh outbreak the secretaries

civic magistrates to preserve the public peace."<a name="FNanchor_457" id="FNanchor_457"></a><a href="#Footnote_457" class="fnanchor">[457]</a>
This was scarcely true. The mayor, aldermen and
sheriffs appear to have done their duty, but they
experienced no little difficulty in getting the marshalmen
and constables&mdash;who were no friends to the
Catholics, and had no real wish to save them from
the mob&mdash;to do theirs. One marshalman, in fact,
openly refused to obey the summons that was sent
him, declaring that he would not go to protect any
such Popish rascals, and for this he was suspended
from office.<a name="FNanchor_458" id="FNanchor_458"></a><a href="#Footnote_458" class="fnanchor">[458]</a> The mayor, in reply, justified himself
(and with reason) by laying the blame upon the
commanding officer at the Tower, who had failed to
supply him with the requisite assistance. Lord
Stormont accepted the mayor's explanation, and
immediately sent copies of his letter to the field
officer of the guards with directions to send to the
city forthwith a detachment of foot guards and light
dragoons, as well as to the commanding officer at the
Tower, directing him to supply the lord mayor with
such assistance as he might require.<a name="FNanchor_459" id="FNanchor_459"></a><a href="#Footnote_459" class="fnanchor">[459]</a></p>

preventing the growth of Popery," the Papists had
experienced no persecution, and the state had enjoyed
perfect tranquility, and that the repealing of part of
the Act had occasioned much discontent and produced
dangerous tumults. The petitioners therefore prayed
that the repealing Act should be itself repealed as
being in their opinion "the most probable means of
immediately quieting the minds of the people." The
sheriffs and the remembrancer were instructed to
present the petition to the House of Commons
without delay, but rather than listen to a debate for
a repeal of the Act, of which General Conway had

once signified his disapproval on the ground that
"no person can bear arms in this country but under
officers having the king's commission," and he instructed
Colonel Twistleton (13 June) to see that all
arms in the hands of persons who were not of the
City militia, or authorised by the king to be armed,
were given up. The existing London Association
which had been on duty since the beginning of the

<p>This reply being deemed unsatisfactory, the lord
mayor wrote a second letter (17 June) pointing out
that Lord Amherst's orders to Colonel Twistleton, of
the 13th, would, if literally executed, disarm those
very persons without whose assistance it would have
been impossible for the civic authorities to have
executed the Order of Council of the 9th instant.
This (he explains) is what was meant in his former
letter, when he said that Lord Amherst's letters
militated against the orders first received from the
Lords of the Council, and the Court of Aldermen
now desired him to submit to his lordship's consideration
"whether some further explanation might
not be necessary to prevent a construction which
would leave the civil magistrate without power to
act at all, for want of necessary support."<a name="FNanchor_473" id="FNanchor_473"></a><a href="#Footnote_473" class="fnanchor">[473]</a></p>

<p>The lord mayor's letter having been submitted to
the Lords of the Council, the President replied, three
days later (20 June), that in the opinion of their
lordships the matter had been fully explained in his
letter of the 15th. With regard, however, to the
alleged impracticability of executing the Orders of
Council of the 9th instant without the assistance of
the inhabitants of the several wards who had armed
themselves, the Council was of opinion that in times
of danger "a reasonable number of inhabitants, armed
according to the nature and circumstances of the
case, may attend the peace-officers, as assistants to
them, for the preservation of the public peace, until
the danger be over." He concluded by reminding
the aldermen that the privilege enjoyed by subjects
of carrying arms under the Bill of Rights (to which
they had referred in the mayor's last letter) did not
extend to mustering and arraying armed bodies without
the king's permission.<a name="FNanchor_474" id="FNanchor_474"></a><a href="#Footnote_474" class="fnanchor">[474]</a> The next day (21 June)

<p>Still the Court of Aldermen were far from being

to arise in the execution of their duty if the military
were to be allowed to act independently. They
desired, therefore, the lord mayor once more to
address the President of the Council with the view of
getting the order of the adjutant-general respecting
the military acting without previous directions from

was useless, therefore, for the Court of Aldermen to

not only made an attack on the lord mayor for not
having taken proper precautions to prevent their

having been moved in the Court after many of the

former friend and colleague, Alderman Bull, who (he
said) had not only omitted to take steps to quell the
rioters, but had allowed the constables of his wards to
"wear the ensigns of riot in their hats," and had been
seen leaving the House of Commons arm-in-arm with

only the external walls being left standing. The

however, recovered his seat upon Kirkman's death,
which occurred within a few days after his election.
A year later (Sept., 1781) Hayley died, and Lord

of high treason, made some show of contesting
the seat. He soon, however, discovered that the

<div class="sidenote">
Proceedings
of Common
Hall,
6 Dec., 1781.</div>

<p>The news of the capitulation of Cornwallis and
his army at Yorktown which reached London on
Sunday, the 25th November (1781), induced the
livery to urge the king once more to put an end to
the war. A Common Hall was summoned by special
request to meet on Thursday, the 6th December.
Alderman Bull being too ill to attend and to consult
his constituents as he wished, contented himself
with addressing a letter to the "Gentlemen of the
Livery" calling upon them to continue to be an example
to the nation, as they always had been. With
their assistance he hoped to see a change effected
which should put an end to the evils from which the
country was suffering. This letter having been read
to the livery they proceeded to consider the terms
of a new remonstrance, which was produced ready
cut and dried. After expressing concern at the king's
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span>recent speech in Parliament, declaring his intention to
persevere in a system of measures which had already
proved so disastrous, the document plainly told the
king that he had been deluded by his ministers, and
the consequences of that delusion had been the
almost total extinction of trade and commerce, and
the annihilation of public and private credit. "Your
majesty's fleets"&mdash;it went on to say&mdash;"have lost
their wonted superiority. Your armies have been
captured. Your dominions have been lost." The
petitioners expressed a desire publicly to declare not
only to the king, but to Europe and to America itself,
their abhorence of the continuation of the unnatural
and unfortunate war, which could only tend to the
alienation of the American colonies with whom they
still hoped to live on terms of intercourse and friendship
so necessary to the commercial prosperity of the
kingdom; and they concluded by imploring his
majesty to dismiss his present advisers as a pledge
to the world of his determination to abandon a
system incompatible with the interests of his crown
and the happiness of his people.<a name="FNanchor_490" id="FNanchor_490"></a><a href="#Footnote_490" class="fnanchor">[490]</a></p>

<p>The remonstrance was ordered to be presented
by the lord mayor, the city members, the Court of
Aldermen [<i>not</i> the Common Council], the sheriffs and
ten of the livery&mdash;the number permitted by Stat. 13,
Chas. II, c. 5&mdash;attended by the Recorder and city
officers; and notwithstanding all previous objections
on the part of the king it was resolved that the sheriffs
should enquire when his Majesty would be pleased to
receive it on the throne. The result was such as might
have been, and no doubt was, expected. When those<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span>
"fellows in fur,"<a name="FNanchor_491" id="FNanchor_491"></a><a href="#Footnote_491" class="fnanchor">[491]</a> as George called the sheriffs,
attended at court to deliver their message, the king
told them he would consider the matter, and would
let them know; and in due course Lord Hertford
addressed (10 Dec.) the following letter to the
mayor:&mdash;"It is well known to be the settled custom
for the King to receive upon the Throne an address
from the City of London only in their corporate
capacity, and the same was signified by a letter
written by me, in obedience to His Majesty's
command, on the eleventh of April, 1775, to the
then Lord Mayor. In consequence thereof I am
commanded by His Majesty to acquaint you that
His Majesty will receive at the lev&eacute;e on Friday the
14th inst. the Address, Petition and Remonstrance
of the Lord Mayor, Aldermen and Livery in Common
Hall assembled. I have, etc." To this the mayor
replied by referring the lord chamberlain to Wilkes's
letter of the 2nd May, 1775, as to the question of
custom. With regard to the present address, petition
and remonstrance he contented himself with representing
to his lordship that as the resolution of the
livery was that it should be presented to the king on
the throne, the persons directed by the said resolution
to present it could not dispense therewith by presenting
it in any other mode.<a name="FNanchor_492" id="FNanchor_492"></a><a href="#Footnote_492" class="fnanchor">[492]</a> The remonstrance was

parliaments and fairer representation. They declared
that the Committee of Correspondence appointed by

the Common Council to grant the use of their

for peace being opened on the basis of an acknowledgment

change of government had taken place the Common

<div class="sidenote">Parliamentary
reform, 1782.</div>

<p>The new ministers were pledged to do something
towards purifying Parliament, and accordingly they
carried a measure disqualifying contractors from
sitting in the House of Commons, unless their
contract should have been made at a public bidding.
It was thought that government contractors might be
too easily moved to support the party that happened
to be in power. Alderman Harley, who sat with Sir
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span>George Cornewall for the county of Hereford, was one
of those whom the Bill affected, inasmuch as he held
a contract for supplying the army in Canada, Nova
Scotia, Carolina, New York and the West Indies with
money. He rose from his seat in the House and
boldly defended himself. He had never (he said)
asked for the contract; he was not in the habit of
asking favours of ministers; "he got his contract in
consequence of an address which the late Lord
Suffolk intended to have moved to the king, that
his majesty would be pleased to confer upon him
some mark of his favour ... he was afterwards
offered a pension which he would not accept,
saying at the same time that he had rather have
something in the way of his profession; on this he
got the gold contract, which he fulfilled for twelve
years with the fairest character, and he now felt
himself hurt indeed that he should be treated as if
he were a criminal, in being forced to give up a
valuable branch of his business, or renounce the
honour, which he held so high, of sitting in Parliament."<a name="FNanchor_501" id="FNanchor_501"></a><a href="#Footnote_501" class="fnanchor">[501]</a>
The measure was carried on the 1st May.
As Harley retained his seat, and continued to hold it
until 1802, it is presumed he gave up his contract.
On the 7th, William Pitt, the second son of the
late Earl Chatham&mdash;who had already displayed such
oratorical powers in defence of Burke's economical
reform Bill that Burke himself, no less delighted than
surprised, had declared him to be not a chip of the
old block, but "the old block itself"<a name="FNanchor_502" id="FNanchor_502"></a><a href="#Footnote_502" class="fnanchor">[502]</a>&mdash;moved for
a committee to examine into the state of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span>representation of the country. The motion was
rejected by only a majority of twenty, the closest
division that the reformers ever achieved until 1831,
the eve of their ultimate success.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Military

<p>The ministers now turned their attention to a

mayor enclosing copies of a plan for augmenting the
home force, and of a circular thereon he had sent to
the chief magistrates of principal towns. His majesty
(the letter said) expected that "his faithful citizens of
London" would set an example to the rest of the
kingdom, as they had so often done before, in
gathering forces for the protection of their sovereign
and their country; the more so, as the city of London
had greater interests at stake. The Common Council
not only voted (17 May) a sum of &pound;5,000 to put the
City militia on a proper footing, but resolved to invite
subscriptions in the several wards of the city, and to
send copies of Shelburne's letter to all the chartered
and trading companies of the city.<a name="FNanchor_503" id="FNanchor_503"></a><a href="#Footnote_503" class="fnanchor">[503]</a> The matter had
already (9 May) been laid before the Court of

proceed to accomplish his majesty's wish "and to do

<p>In September Lord Howe set sail to relieve
Gibraltar, which had endured a siege of three years

raised to the peerage as Lord Heathfield, and
the sufferings of the garrison had at times been terrible.
When Shelburne succeeded to the premiership, on the
death of Rockingham in July, negotiations for a peace
with America and her allies were far advanced, but
before a peace was signed France and Spain were
anxious above all things to regain Gibraltar. Accordingly
on the 13th September a tremendous attack was
made on the fortress by the combined fleets. The forts
replied with red hot shot, and eventually succeeded
in destroying the floating batteries. Just when these
were silenced Lord Howe appeared in the bay,
and the combined fleet, not venturing to attack him,
withdrew. The siege had attracted the eyes of all
Europe, and in February (1783) the Common Council
appointed a committee to consider the most suitable
mode to be adopted by the City to express their
respect to Elliot and Howe and the officers of the
army and navy employed in "the glorious defence

as her failures in America had led them to believe,
and they now showed a disposition to negotiate.
Accordingly in January (1783) preliminaries of peace
were signed at Paris. A provisional treaty had
already been concluded with America, by which the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span>independence of the United States was formally
acknowledged. The news was received in the city
with the greatest joy, and the Common Council
congratulated the king on his having paid "final
attention" to the petitions of his faithful citizens and
people. They took the opportunity of expressing
their firm conviction that the commercial interests of
this country and of North America were inseparably
united&mdash;a sentiment with which the king declared in
his reply that he entirely concurred&mdash;and hoped that
the stipulations of the treaty would restore commercial
intercourse between the two countries.<a name="FNanchor_512" id="FNanchor_512"></a><a href="#Footnote_512" class="fnanchor">[512]</a> The
preliminaries of both treaties were converted into
definitive treaties on the 3rd September, and on the
6th October the peace was proclaimed in the city of
London in the same manner as at the proclamation of
peace with France on the 22nd March, 1763.<a name="FNanchor_513" id="FNanchor_513"></a><a href="#Footnote_513" class="fnanchor">[513]</a></p>

privy council; but discharged the same evening." A modern writer
goes so far as to say "the lord mayor was tried and convicted of
criminal negligence." (Bright, Hist, of England iii, 1, 094). Another
goes still further, and states that he was "prosecuted by the attorney
general for a gross neglect of duty and was convicted, but his death
prevented the passing sentence." (See note by editor of Letters of
George III to Lord North, ii, 324). As a matter of fact Kennet did

to enable him to proceed to Germany for the purpose of painting certain

Common Council taking cognisance of what was a private pecuniary
transaction, and declined to pay Boydell out of the sum voted by the

200 guineas to Boydell direct. This was in March, 1794. Five years

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XLI" id="CHAPTER_XLI">CHAPTER XLI.</a></h2>


<div class="sidenote">The City and
Fox's East
India Bill,
1783.</div>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Vide</i> Printed
addresses.</div>

<p>Before the preliminaries of peace became converted
into definite treaties, the Shelburne ministry
had been forced to give way to a coalition with Fox
and North as secretaries of state, and the Duke
of Portland as nominal head. The new ministry
found little favour with the City, firstly on account
of its Stamp Act&mdash;imposing a duty upon all receipts
for sums of forty shillings and upwards&mdash;which the
citizens (wrongly, as it turned out) believed would be
a hindrance to trade;<a name="FNanchor_514" id="FNanchor_514"></a><a href="#Footnote_514" class="fnanchor">[514]</a> and secondly on account of
Fox's attack on the chartered rights of the East India
Company. If Fox's East India Bill were passed,
what, they asked, was to become of their own
chartered rights and privileges? Every corporation
in the kingdom was solemnly warned of the consequences
to themselves if the Bill were allowed to
pass. "Our property and charter are invaded, look
to your own" was the message the Company sent,
together with a copy of Fox's Bill, to every borough
in the country. The Bill passed the Commons, but
when it came before the Lords the king declared
himself so strongly against it that it was thrown out,
and before the close of the year (1783) the ministers
were suddenly and somewhat unceremoniously
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span>dismissed. For the first time in history we find the
City unanimously supporting the king in the exercise
of his prerogative. The Common Council hastened
to assure his majesty that his faithful citizens had
"lately beheld with infinite concern the progress of
a measure which equally tended to encroach on the
rights of your majesty's crown, to annihilate the
chartered rights of the East India Company, and to
raise a new power unknown to this free government
and highly inimical to its safety. [As the dangerous
measure was warmly supported by your majesty's
late ministers, we heartily rejoice in their dismission,
and humbly thank your majesty for exerting your
prerogative in a manner so salutary and constitutional."]
Finally they assured the king that as
the prerogatives of his majesty's high office were
intended for the good of the people, the citizens of
London would always support the constitutional
exercise of them to the utmost of their power. In
other words, the king might always look to the City
for support so long as he was content to exercise his
prerogative for the preservation of "parliamentary
engagements" and chartered rights.<a name="FNanchor_515" id="FNanchor_515"></a><a href="#Footnote_515" class="fnanchor">[515]</a> The livery and
the Common Council, so long opposed to each other,
became allies again, and the former body passed a
formal vote of thanks at a special Common Hall
(13 Feb., 1784) to the representative body of the
City for the address they had carried up to the throne
"thereby setting an example to the whole kingdom."<a name="FNanchor_516" id="FNanchor_516"></a><a href="#Footnote_516" class="fnanchor">[516]</a>
Truly, as Macaulay remarks, "the successors of the
old Roundheads had turned courtiers." Not content
with thanking the Common Council for its attitude in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>the matter, the livery passed resolutions of their own
in support of the just prerogative of the crown, the
privileges of Parliament and the rights of the people,
whilst they ordered that the city members should
be instructed to advance in every way the business
of the House, and particularly by the granting of
supplies.<a name="FNanchor_517" id="FNanchor_517"></a><a href="#Footnote_517" class="fnanchor">[517]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Pitt's struggle
with the
Coalition,
1783-1784.</div>

<p>Fox's East India Bill had been strongly opposed
by Pitt, who at the early age of twenty-three had
been Chancellor of the Exchequer and leader of the
House of Commons under the Shelburne ministry.
It was to this youth that the king now appealed
for assistance, and although the task of forming a
ministry of any stability was almost beyond hope,
Pitt undertook the struggle. As it was useless to
look for any support in the Commons he chose his
cabinet entirely from the Upper House, reserving
for himself the post of First Commissioner of the
Treasury and Chancellor of the Exchequer. Even
before Pitt was able to take his seat as prime minister
(a new election being necessary on his accepting
office), it was evident that the Opposition intended to
show him no pity or favour. It was not until the 12th
January (1784)&mdash;the day that the House re-assembled
after the Christmas recess&mdash;that he made his first
appearance as prime minister. He came prepared
with an India Bill, similar in most respects to that
which he afterwards succeeded in carrying, but the
Bill was now rejected although by a small majority.
For weeks he struggled against the violent attacks of
the Opposition, refusing either to resign or to dissolve<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span>
Parliament until he could take his opponents at a
disadvantage.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Civic honours
for Pitt,
Feb., 1784.</div>

<p>At length, the nation at large became attracted
by the indomitable courage and unflinching honesty
of the young minister and began to rally round him.
The city of London had been from the outset one of
his staunchest supporters. On the 10th February
(1784), the Common Council voted him the Freedom
of the City and a gold box for his zeal in "supporting
the legal prerogative of the crown and the constitutional
rights of the people."<a name="FNanchor_518" id="FNanchor_518"></a><a href="#Footnote_518" class="fnanchor">[518]</a> On the 28th,
he was made free of the Grocers' Company and
hospitably entertained by them in their hall. There
are members of the Grocers' Company still alive who
can recall the time when "the immortal memory of
William Pitt" was honoured in solemn silence at all
public gatherings in Grocers' Hall, and the esteem in
which the company continues to hold one of the
greatest statesmen that England has ever produced
recently manifested itself afresh, when on the 28th
February, 1884, the Grocers celebrated the "Pitt
Centenary" by a banquet in their hall.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Dissolution of
Parliament
and defeat of
Whigs, 1784.</div>

<p>As soon as the minister perceived the attack of
the Opposition wearing itself out, and the balance of
parties becoming more equal, he seized the opportunity
of dissolving Parliament and appealing to the
country. One of the first elections to take place was,
as usual, that for the City. Without his knowledge or
consent Pitt himself was nominated among others;
he declined, however, to stand, and was eventually
returned for Cambridge University, a seat he continued<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>
to hold for the remainder of his life. The result of
the City election was that all the old members were
returned,<a name="FNanchor_519" id="FNanchor_519"></a><a href="#Footnote_519" class="fnanchor">[519]</a> although Sawbridge nearly lost his seat in
consequence of his attachment to Fox.<a name="FNanchor_520" id="FNanchor_520"></a><a href="#Footnote_520" class="fnanchor">[520]</a> It soon
became evident that the country was with Pitt. No
less than 160 of Fox's friends and supporters&mdash;"Fox's
martyrs," as they were popularly called&mdash;lost their
seats, and Fox himself had, for a time, to content
himself with a seat for a close borough, although he
was eventually returned for Westminster, after one of
the severest contests ever known.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Pitt's East
India Bill.
1784.</div>

<p>When the new Parliament met (18 May) three
subjects more especially demanded attention. These
were the finances of the country, the affairs of the
East India Company, and the state of Ireland. The
first two were immediately taken in hand. Having
in an incredibly short time placed the finance of the
country on a firm basis, Pitt again introduced his
East India Bill. This Bill, it must be borne in mind,
differed essentially from Fox's Bill, which had recently
excited such fears in the City, inasmuch as it merely
proposed to establish a board of control for political
purposes, and did not lay a finger upon the company's
material possessions. The chartered rights of the
company being left untouched, the directors offered no
opposition, the fears of the City for their own chartered
rights and possessions were lulled, and the Bill was
allowed to pass. The dual system then established
proved to work so well that it continued to be the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span>system under which India was governed from that
day down to 1858.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Pitt's Reform

<p>In the course of the session Sawbridge brought
forward his perennial motion in favour of short parliaments,

notwithstanding his deeming it inopportune, the motion
was lost.<a name="FNanchor_521" id="FNanchor_521"></a><a href="#Footnote_521" class="fnanchor">[521]</a> In the following spring (1785) Pitt himself
for the third, and, as it proved, for the last, time
attempted to carry a measure for parliamentary reform,
but this, too, was defeated, and, strange to say, by the
same majority as Sawbridge's motion.<a name="FNanchor_522" id="FNanchor_522"></a><a href="#Footnote_522" class="fnanchor">[522]</a> The Common

<div class="sidenote">The City and
the Shop Tax,
May, 1785.</div>

<p>One of the many schemes which he proposed for
filling the exchequer was a tax on retail shops. As
soon as the proposal got wind the City was at once up
in arms, and a committee was appointed (14 May,
1785) to confer with Pitt on the matter. Upon the
citizens objecting that they would have to bear nearly
the whole burden of the tax, they were told they
could recoup themselves by raising the price of their
goods to the consumer.<a name="FNanchor_524" id="FNanchor_524"></a><a href="#Footnote_524" class="fnanchor">[524]</a> Disappointed in this quarter,
they resolved to lay their case before Parliament;
and accordingly a petition was drawn up, which set
forth that the citizens of London had always been
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span>ready and willing to bear their fair share of the
necessary burdens of the state, but that the tax now
proposed was partial, unjust and oppressive to trade;
that the inhabitants and traders of the city were
already overburdened with taxation; that London
and Middlesex paid 80 parts out of 513, or more than
one-sixth of the whole Land Tax annually raised
in the kingdom; and that, finally, it was a grave
mistake to suppose that a tax on trade eventually fell
on the consumers, for the price of every commodity
was regulated by supply and demand.<a name="FNanchor_525" id="FNanchor_525"></a><a href="#Footnote_525" class="fnanchor">[525]</a> This petition
was laid before the House on the 19th May, but with
little effect, and on the 30th the Bill passed the
Commons<a name="FNanchor_526" id="FNanchor_526"></a><a href="#Footnote_526" class="fnanchor">[526]</a> in spite of the strong protest against it
made by the city members, who received the thanks

opposition to a tax "universally condemned for its
partiality and injustice."<a name="FNanchor_527" id="FNanchor_527"></a><a href="#Footnote_527" class="fnanchor">[527]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Efforts to get
it repealed,
1785-1789.</div>

<p>No sooner was the Bill passed than a committee
of shopkeepers was formed to get it repealed, and in
this they were assisted by the committee appointed
by the Common Council on the 14th May. The
costs incurred by the latter committee were to be
discharged to the extent of &pound;300 out of the City's
Chamber.<a name="FNanchor_528" id="FNanchor_528"></a><a href="#Footnote_528" class="fnanchor">[528]</a> In November (1785), the Common
Council instructed their committee to prepare a
petition to Parliament for a repeal of the obnoxious
Act. This was accordingly done and the petition
duly laid before the House, but with no better
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span>success than before (27 Jan., 1786).<a name="FNanchor_529" id="FNanchor_529"></a><a href="#Footnote_529" class="fnanchor">[529]</a> In the meantime
a split had occurred among the commissioners
whose duty it was to carry out the provisions of the
Act. Some of them had duly qualified themselves
for the purpose, whilst others had not, and so long as
disagreement continued among the executive officers,
the City shop-keeper ran the risk of incurring a double
assessment.<a name="FNanchor_530" id="FNanchor_530"></a><a href="#Footnote_530" class="fnanchor">[530]</a> Early in 1787, the agitation was
renewed, and the mayor was asked to allow of a
meeting of the discontents in the Guildhall on the
evening of Friday, the 19th January. The mayor
was willing enough, but the Court of Aldermen were
afraid of a disturbance and the meeting was put off.<a name="FNanchor_531" id="FNanchor_531"></a><a href="#Footnote_531" class="fnanchor">[531]</a>
A fortnight later (31 Jan.) the Common Council
resolved to present another petition to Parliament
for the repeal of the Act. Further experience, they
assured the House, had confirmed their opinion of
the partiality and oppression of the Act, and of the
impossibility of shifting the burden upon the consumer.<a name="FNanchor_532" id="FNanchor_532"></a><a href="#Footnote_532" class="fnanchor">[532]</a>
The petition was presented the following

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span>until in April, 1789, they were at last crowned with

<div class="sidenote">Convention
with France,

<p>The Shop Tax was not the only point in Pitt's
financial schemes which tended to bring him into
direct opposition to the City, as we shall shorty see;
but as a whole his schemes were eminently successful,
and not the least successful of them all was his
commercial treaty with France. Duties were lowered
in each country on the productions of the other and
both England and France were the better for the
change, but the treaty as originally drafted threatened
unfortunately to diminish the revenues of the city of
London. Pitt's attention having been drawn to the
matter, a proviso was inserted in a subsequent convention
signed at Versailles (15 Jan., 1787) whereby
the City's rights were safeguarded.<a name="FNanchor_537" id="FNanchor_537"></a><a href="#Footnote_537" class="fnanchor">[537]</a> The convention
was followed in October by a joint declaration

<div class="sidenote">The City and
the slave

1788-1792.</div>

<p>The year 1788 witnessed the first steps taken in
Parliament for the abolition of the slave trade.
Wilberforce a prominent leader in the movement
succeeded in winning over Pitt to the cause, and the
City threw its influence into the scale. On the
4th February, the Common Council petitioned the
House to take the matter into its consideration.<a name="FNanchor_539" id="FNanchor_539"></a><a href="#Footnote_539" class="fnanchor">[539]</a>
Little however was done beyond the introduction of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span>a temporary measure for improving the sanitary condition
of vessels employed in the slave traffic. The Bill
passed the Commons, but underwent such a change in
the House of Lords that it became practically useless.
In 1789, and again in 1790, Wilberforce urged the
Commons to abolish the slave trade in its entirety,
and in 1792, Pitt supported the proposal in a speech
which surpassed all his previous oratorical efforts.
It was to no purpose. The Liverpool merchants, whose
interests in the nefarious traffic were enormous,
succeeded in frustrating every attempt to put it
down. At last, even the city of London refused to
petition Parliament any further on the matter.<a name="FNanchor_540" id="FNanchor_540"></a><a href="#Footnote_540" class="fnanchor">[540]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Pitt's Regency
Bill,
1788-1789.</div>

<p>In the meanwhile an event had occurred which
for the moment threatened to overthrow the ministry.
In November, 1788, the king who had previously
shown signs of mental derangement became so
seriously ill that a regency seemed inevitable. That
the Prince of Wales ought to be Regent all parties
were agreed, but whether he should be allowed to
take upon himself the regency as a matter of right,
or whether he should accept it at the hands of
Parliament and with such limitations as Parliament
might think fit to create, opinions differed. Pitt was
strongly in favour of upholding the authority of
Parliament in the matter and introduced a Regency
Bill. The Bill passed the Commons, but before it
passed the Lords the king unexpectedly recovered,
and further proceedings were stayed. For having
thus maintained "the important right of the Lords
and Commons of this realm to provide the means
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span>for supplying the defect of the personal exercise of
the royal authority arising from his majesty's indisposition,"
the Common Council passed a vote of
thanks to Pitt and his supporters, which the minister
duly acknowledged;<a name="FNanchor_541" id="FNanchor_541"></a><a href="#Footnote_541" class="fnanchor">[541]</a> but when it was proposed to
present an address to the prince condoling with him
on the king's illness, and congratulating him upon
his being invested with the government "by the
united wisdom of the two Houses," a debate of
three hours ensued and the motion was eventually
lost.<a name="FNanchor_542" id="FNanchor_542"></a><a href="#Footnote_542" class="fnanchor">[542]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Gift of &pound;1,000

the city Chamberlain the sum of &pound;1,000 for the poor

of the season, as he feared that his father's illness
might prevent the king sending his usual annual gift.
The Common Council were touched with the prince's
thoughtful act of charity, and sent to Carlton House
to thank him. His highness took the opportunity of
assuring them that no one was more sensible than
himself of the attention of the City, and no one would
be more ready to show regard "towards the most

<p>Towards the end of February (1789) the king
was himself again. The news of his recovery was a
cause of sincere joy to the city of London, as well as
to the nation at large, however disappointing to those
who had built their hopes upon a regency. On the
night of the 10th March the whole of London was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span>illuminated. From one extremity of the town to the
other and far out into the surrounding suburbs there
was one blaze of light. Two days later the Common
Council prepared congratulatory addresses to the king
and queen. These were presented to their majesties
at Kew on the Thursday, the 19th March, and were
graciously received, the City on this occasion, in
compliance with the king's wishes, who was still far

The Earl of Salisbury, in his capacity as lord chamberlain,
suggested that if the lord mayor and sheriffs and
those aldermen who represented the city in Parliament
were to meet the king at Temple Bar and conduct
him to St. Paul's it would be more agreeable to his
majesty than the attendance of a greater number of
persons. For the same reason it was decided that no
more than four members of the Common Council
should attend. The formal presentation to the king
of the City's sword at Temple Bar and of its re-delivery
into the hands of William Gill, the lord mayor, was

to remit the Shop Tax, which had caused so much bad
feeling in the city. Scarcely was this done, however,
before he again gave umbrage to the citizens by a
proposal to transfer the duty on tobacco from the
customs to the excise. Walpole had endeavoured to
carry out a similar change in 1733, but the opposition
he met with was so overpowering that he was obliged
to give way. Pitt was more successful. The City

<div class="sidenote">Negotiations
for the
removal of
the Bank
guard,
1788-1790.</div>

<p>The king's illness had interrupted negotiations
that had been opened for the withdrawal of the
guard of soldiers that had been accustomed ever since
the Gordon riots, to pass through the city daily for
the purpose of protecting the Bank of England. In
1787 a citizen had complained to the Court of Aldermen
of his having been pushed off the footway by
soldiers of the guard passing to the Bank on the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span>evening of the 5th July; and the Court had thereupon
instructed the lord mayor to request the secretary at
war to give such directions as he might think proper
that the guard might in future march in single file
and not two abreast as they hitherto had done.<a name="FNanchor_548" id="FNanchor_548"></a><a href="#Footnote_548" class="fnanchor">[548]</a></p>

<p>The secretary at war (Sir George Yonge) had
replied that the lord mayor's suggestion would be
likely to lead to great inconvenience; that he undertook
to promise that the officers of the guards would
for their part endeavour to conduct their detachments
on the march in a quiet, decent and soldier-like
manner, but that from representations that had been
made to him by officers commanding the guards as
to the treatment the detachments sometimes met
with in their passage through the city, he felt bound
to ask the lord mayor to take such steps as he might
deem fit to prevent any cause of complaint arising in
future on either side.<a name="FNanchor_549" id="FNanchor_549"></a><a href="#Footnote_549" class="fnanchor">[549]</a> This letter had been referred
to a committee, with instructions to report their
opinion as to the best way of affording sufficient
protection to the Bank and at the same time of
avoiding the inconveniences complained of. The
committee showed no haste in the matter, and it
was not until the following May (1788) that they
reported in favour of furnishing the Bank with a
guard of the city's militia, in place of the detachment
of foot guards. The Court of Aldermen on receiving
this report wished to know what the directors of the
Bank of England thought of the suggestion,<a name="FNanchor_550" id="FNanchor_550"></a><a href="#Footnote_550" class="fnanchor">[550]</a> but all
the answer they got was that if the existing mode of
protecting the Bank were discontinued, the directors
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span>would not "put the city to the trouble of providing
any other." The Court scarcely knew how to treat
this answer. At length, after several adjournments,
it resolved (21 Oct.) that the lord mayor should write
to the secretary at war and request that the guard at
the Bank should be withdrawn.<a name="FNanchor_551" id="FNanchor_551"></a><a href="#Footnote_551" class="fnanchor">[551]</a> Four days later
Sir George Yonge informed the lord mayor by letter
that the matter had been referred to his majesty's
ministers, that the directors of the Bank had been
desired to attend Lord Sydney on the subject, and
that further information would be given as soon as
the king's pleasure should be known.<a name="FNanchor_552" id="FNanchor_552"></a><a href="#Footnote_552" class="fnanchor">[552]</a></p>

<p>The king's severe illness served as an excuse for
letting the matter drop, and nothing more was done
until January, 1790, when Pickett, the lord mayor, on
his own responsibility and without any authority from
the Court of Aldermen, wrote to Grenville, then
secretary of state (having previously solicited an
interview with Sir George Yonge), desiring to know
the king's pleasure as to the removal of the Bank
guard. Grenville replied by asking the lord mayor
to specify on what grounds his application was made,
and whether the resolution of the Court of Aldermen
of the 21st October, 1788 (referred to in his letter),
was based on "any legal right or exemption claimed
by the City."<a name="FNanchor_553" id="FNanchor_553"></a><a href="#Footnote_553" class="fnanchor">[553]</a> The secretary was told in reply that
no reasons were assigned for the resolution of the
Court of Aldermen, nor had any been desired by
the late secretary of state when approached on the
subject; but the lord mayor volunteered some reasons
of his own (27 Jan). He apprehended that "the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span>unnecessary introduction of the military into the civil
government of this nation" was unconstitutional.
The Bank guard was originally adopted at the time
of an extraordinary crisis. It was no longer needed,
or if needed, could be more constitutionally furnished
by the city's militia. The introduction of the
regulars was considered an infringement of the ancient
privileges of the City,<a name="FNanchor_554" id="FNanchor_554"></a><a href="#Footnote_554" class="fnanchor">[554]</a> and their presence was an
annoyance to his majesty's peaceable and commercial
subjects. This answer of the lord mayor seemed
far from satisfactory to the secretary of state as it
ignored the question whether the City claimed any
privilege. As soon as the mayor satisfied him on
this point, he promised to take an early opportunity
of consulting the king. The correspondence having
been laid before the Court of Aldermen, the Court
showed a disposition to let the matter rest. The
mayor, however, wrote another letter to Grenville
(notwithstanding the Court's request that he should
do nothing more without instructions from them),
intimating that he would still have to press the
withdrawal of the guard as "unconstitutional, unnecessary,
and offensive," but its only effect was to
draw forth a formal acknowledgment of its receipt
by the secretary of state, and there the matter was
allowed to drop.<a name="FNanchor_555" id="FNanchor_555"></a><a href="#Footnote_555" class="fnanchor">[555]</a></p>

interest, if not with approval, as of a nation struggling
to be free. But in course of time the sparks of
sedition crossed the channel, and it became necessary
to suppress by royal proclamation (21 May, 1792)
the numerous pamphlets with which the country was
flooded. Fox was one of the few statesmen who still
believed in the honesty of purpose underlying the
revolution, and he signified publicly his disapproval
of the proclamation. The City supported the king,
however, and its example was widely followed by
other corporate bodies throughout the kingdom.<a name="FNanchor_556" id="FNanchor_556"></a><a href="#Footnote_556" class="fnanchor">[556]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">The

<p>Pitt had hoped to save England by preserving
a strict neutrality, and for a time he was successful,
although frequently urged to declare war. The
massacres of September (1792) rendered his peace
policy almost hopeless by the shock they gave to
English public opinion. The streets of London
swarmed with French refugees, and subscriptions
had to be opened for their relief.<a name="FNanchor_557" id="FNanchor_557"></a><a href="#Footnote_557" class="fnanchor">[557]</a> How imminent

<div class="sidenote">Resolutions

29 Nov., 1792.</div>

<p>With the spirit of revolution thus rife in the city
the new lord mayor (Sir James Sanderson) had his
hands full. He proved himself, however, equal to
the occasion, and the Common Council thanked him
(29 Nov.) for his pains in suppressing seditious
meetings,<a name="FNanchor_559" id="FNanchor_559"></a><a href="#Footnote_559" class="fnanchor">[559]</a> and promised him every assistance in the
work of carrying into execution his majesty's late
proclamation. The council at the same time passed
a series of resolutions touching the duty of every
corporation and every freeman to suppress seditious
assemblies, and to bring to justice every disturber of
the peace, and gave orders to the aldermen and
common councilmen of each ward to take steps for
the preservation of tranquility and for securing
obedience to the law. These resolutions were to be
printed in all the public papers of the United
Kingdom.<a name="FNanchor_560" id="FNanchor_560"></a><a href="#Footnote_560" class="fnanchor">[560]</a> The officers and men of the London

<div class="sidenote">War declared
by France,
1 Feb., 1793.</div>

<p>In anticipation of war being sooner or later
declared by one side or the other the Common
Council resolved on the 10th January (1793) to offer
bounties for seamen for a term not exceeding one
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span>month from that date.<a name="FNanchor_562" id="FNanchor_562"></a><a href="#Footnote_562" class="fnanchor">[562]</a> Before that month expired
the blow had fallen. Instead of England declaring
war France took the initiative, and after sending
her king to the scaffold declared war against England
(1 Feb.). The citizens immediately extended their
bounties for another month,<a name="FNanchor_563" id="FNanchor_563"></a><a href="#Footnote_563" class="fnanchor">[563]</a> and pledged themselves
to stand by the king and constitution.<a name="FNanchor_564" id="FNanchor_564"></a><a href="#Footnote_564" class="fnanchor">[564]</a> They
furthermore contributed the sum of &pound;500 to the fund
that was being raised by merchants of the city for
privateering purposes.<a name="FNanchor_565" id="FNanchor_565"></a><a href="#Footnote_565" class="fnanchor">[565]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">The campaign
of 1793.</div>

<p>In the course of the spring a British force, under
the command of the Duke of York, landed at Ostend,
and having joined the imperial army under the Prince
of Saxe-Coburg, contributed in no small measure to
the success achieved against the French during the
earlier part of the campaign. Later on the Duke of
York attempted the siege of Dunkirk, but was compelled
to retire. A ward committee was appointed in
the City for the purpose of raising subscriptions for
providing the troops with warm clothing and other
necessaries during the winter, and the Common
Council voted the sum of &pound;500 for the same
purpose.<a name="FNanchor_566" id="FNanchor_566"></a><a href="#Footnote_566" class="fnanchor">[566]</a> Subscriptions came in from various parts
of the country. Some towns, like Wigan and Hereford,
sent clothing, but most of them sent cash. The
result was that the City was able to despatch to the
army a large number of greatcoats, trousers, shoes,
stockings, shirts, mittens and other articles of apparel
to the value of nearly &pound;4,000. An offer made by the
Grocers' Company to furnish the troops with a supply
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span>of "porter" was declined by the committee with
thanks, as it appeared to them that "the advantage
thereof could only be partial and temporary at best."<a name="FNanchor_567" id="FNanchor_567"></a><a href="#Footnote_567" class="fnanchor">[567]</a>
The Duke of York, writing from Ghent (10 Jan.,

the patience and courage of the troops under his
command.<a name="FNanchor_568" id="FNanchor_568"></a><a href="#Footnote_568" class="fnanchor">[568]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">The "Battle
of the 1st of
June," 1794.</div>

<p>The campaign of 1794 proved disastrous to the
allies, and before the end of the year the Duke of
York resigned his command. The want of success
on the continent was in part compensated by
Howe's victory over the French at sea. The French
had resolved to dispute the sovereignty of the seas,
and had prepared a fleet at Brest. In course of time
Howe fell in with it, and on the 1st June a general
engagement took place, in which the enemy, although
far superior to the English fleet in weight of metal,
was completely worsted. For this victory Howe
received the thanks of Parliament and of the City,
and also the Freedom of the latter in a gold box.<a name="FNanchor_569" id="FNanchor_569"></a><a href="#Footnote_569" class="fnanchor">[569]</a>
The City, moreover, voted a sum of &pound;500 for the
relief of those wounded in the engagement, and of
the widows and children of those who had been
killed. Howe acknowledged the honour conferred
upon him and the liberality and benevolence of the
City towards those who had served under him in
most gracious terms.<a name="FNanchor_570" id="FNanchor_570"></a><a href="#Footnote_570" class="fnanchor">[570]</a> Success also attended our
arms in the West Indies, where Admiral Sir John
Jervis and Lieutenant-General Sir Charles Grey
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span>captured Martinique and other French islands. For
these exploits the Common Council voted both gallant
officers the Freedom of the City and gold boxes,<a name="FNanchor_571" id="FNanchor_571"></a><a href="#Footnote_571" class="fnanchor">[571]</a> and
presented a congratulatory address to the king.<a name="FNanchor_572" id="FNanchor_572"></a><a href="#Footnote_572" class="fnanchor">[572]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Riots in the
city, Aug.,
1794.</div>

<p>In the meantime (17 April) proceedings had been
taken to raise a regiment of infantry and a troop of
cavalry to be called "The Loyal London Volunteers."
Their chief duty was to be the defence of the city,
but they were to be ready to enter the service of the
government whenever occasion might require. A
committee was nominated to raise subscriptions, and
an Act of Parliament was passed for placing the
Militia of the City on a better footing.<a name="FNanchor_573" id="FNanchor_573"></a><a href="#Footnote_573" class="fnanchor">[573]</a> Scarcely
was this done before riots again broke out, and
on the 20th August the mayor (Paul le Mesurier)
had to send for the Honourable Artillery Company
for the protection of houses where recruits were being
enlisted for the army. The military remained on
duty all night in the neighbourhood of Whitecross
Street, and effectually checked the rioters in the
wanton destruction of property. The next night
they were again on duty, this time in Shoe Lane,
where they succeeded in dispelling a mob. For
these services they were not only thanked by the
mayor, but, more formally, by the Common Council,
the latter body extending its acknowledgments to the
light horse volunteers, as well as to the Military
Association at Grocers' Hall, for their respective
services during the crisis.<a name="FNanchor_574" id="FNanchor_574"></a><a href="#Footnote_574" class="fnanchor">[574]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Scarcity of

<p>To add to the City's troubles a famine was
threatening, and on the last day of the year (1794)
the lord mayor received instructions to confer with

ministry) as to the best means of averting the
calamity.<a name="FNanchor_575" id="FNanchor_575"></a><a href="#Footnote_575" class="fnanchor">[575]</a> In the course of the next twelvemonth

all Corporation dinners for one whole year, in order
that the money thus saved might be devoted to the
poor; but the civic fathers had not the courage to
adopt such a self-denying ordinance, although they
consented to a compromise. They agreed that no
committee should dine at the City's expense between
the 16th July and the 1st October.<a name="FNanchor_577" id="FNanchor_577"></a><a href="#Footnote_577" class="fnanchor">[577]</a> More than this
they could not do.</p>

<div class="sidenote">"Standard
bread."</div>

<p>In the hope of affording some relief the Lords of
the Council proposed to put a stop to the use of fine
flour for baking purposes, and to substitute a coarse
but wholesome bread known as "standard wheaten
bread" for the better class of bread. Their lordships
themselves set an excellent example by signing a
document pledging themselves and their families
to use no other bread than standard wheaten bread
until the following 1st October (by which time the
harvest would have been gathered in), and to avoid
as far as possible the use of flour in other articles
of food. They further expressed a hope that their
example might be generally followed. There was a
difficulty, however, in adopting the standard wheaten
bread in the city, where the assise of bread was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span>regularly set by the mayor and aldermen. One
reason against it was that its price as fixed by Statute
was so low that bakers could not afford to make it,
and penalties were attached to its sale at a higher
price. The Lords of the Council were asked if they
would indemnify bakers against such penalties if they
infringed the Statute? They replied that this was
beyond their power, but they suggested that the City
might well make good any loss the trade might
sustain, out of public subscriptions.<a name="FNanchor_578" id="FNanchor_578"></a><a href="#Footnote_578" class="fnanchor">[578]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">The City's
desire for
peace,
Jan., 1795.</div>

<p>The scarcity of wheat and the prospect of a bad
harvest in 1795, had already predisposed the citizens
for a cessation of hostilities abroad. As early as the
23rd January, 1795, a special Common Hall had been
summoned by request, and a petition to the House of
Commons had been drawn up praying the House to
disclaim all right of interference in the internal concerns
of France, and to take such measures as it
should seem fit to bring about a speedy peace. The
war, they said, ought never to have been entered
upon and was based on a wrong principle.<a name="FNanchor_579" id="FNanchor_579"></a><a href="#Footnote_579" class="fnanchor">[579]</a> The
Common Council were more reserved, and, whilst
assuring the king of their support, expressed a desire
for such a peace only as could be procured with
dignity and honour.<a name="FNanchor_580" id="FNanchor_580"></a><a href="#Footnote_580" class="fnanchor">[580]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Assault on
the king,
29 Oct., 1795.</div>

<p>As the year wore on and distress increased, the
cry for peace became more general, and the government
resolved upon an Autumn Session. Matters
indeed had become so serious that when the king
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span>drove down to Westminster to open Parliament he
was assailed on all sides with cries of "bread,
bread! peace, peace!" and his carriage window was
broken by a pebble or bullet. On his return he was
again met with similar shouts, and he escaped with
difficulty to Buckingham Palace. The Common
Council at once offered their congratulations on his
providential escape, and expressed their horror at the
attack that had been made upon him. They at the
same time embraced the opportunity, thus afforded,
of thanking him for the declaration he had made
of giving "the fullest and speediest effect to a
negotiation for a general peace," whenever the
condition of affairs in France would allow of it.<a name="FNanchor_581" id="FNanchor_581"></a><a href="#Footnote_581" class="fnanchor">[581]</a> In
consequence of this ebullition of public feeling, Pitt
introduced and passed two Bills, commonly known as
the Sedition and Treason Bills. The severity of
these Bills was thought by many to be unreasonable,
and brought much obloquy upon the minister; but
the necessity of some such steps being taken to put
down sedition was acknowledged by the Common
Council.<a name="FNanchor_582" id="FNanchor_582"></a><a href="#Footnote_582" class="fnanchor">[582]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Negotiations
for peace,

<p>In December (1795), Pitt brought a royal
message to Parliament declaring that the establishment
of a new constitution (viz., the Directory) in
France offered facilities for negotiations,<a name="FNanchor_583" id="FNanchor_583"></a><a href="#Footnote_583" class="fnanchor">[583]</a> and in the
following March (1796), overtures were made through
the British envoy in Switzerland. They were, however,
ungraciously received, and matters remained as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span>they were until the following October, when the king
notified his intention to the new Parliament of
despatching a minister to Paris for the purpose of
re-opening negotiations. By a certain section of the
Common Council the news was received with anything
but favour, and they would gladly have seen
Pitt dismissed. The majority, however, preferred to
present a loyal address to the king, assuring him that
in the event of the negotiations failing he might
depend upon the City for future support in any crisis
that might arise. The king thanked the City.<a name="FNanchor_584" id="FNanchor_584"></a><a href="#Footnote_584" class="fnanchor">[584]</a> As
was feared, the negotiations again proved fruitless.
France was all the while preparing to make a descent
on Ireland, and as soon as these preparations were
complete, the British ambassador was abruptly ordered
to quit Paris (19 Dec.).</p>

<div class="sidenote">The "Loyalty
Loan" of
&pound;18,000,000
Dec., 1796.</div>

<p>Thanks to the minister at the head of affairs the
crisis did not find England unprepared. Fresh levies
had already been made, both for the army and the
navy; supplementary corps of militia had been raised,
and plans laid for forming bodies of irregular infantry
and cavalry. One thing only was wanting, and that
was money. In order to raise this, Pitt at first
thought of introducing a Bill to compel all persons
enjoying a certain amount of income to subscribe
one-fourth for the service of the country. On second
thoughts, however, he preferred to trust to the
patriotic spirit of the nation. He believed that many
would be found ready to contribute even a larger
proportion of their income if only an example were
set by the Bank of England and the Corporation of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span>
London. The sum required was large, being no less
than &pound;18,000,000, and the terms he had to offer
were scarcely remunerative. On the last day of
November he addressed a letter to the governor of
the Bank of England, desiring him to lay the proposal
before the directors, and at the same time expressing
a hope that they might "not be disinclined to take
the lead in a measure which must have the most
beneficial effect on public credit and the most
evident tendency to accelerate the restoration of
peace on secure and honourable terms."<a name="FNanchor_585" id="FNanchor_585"></a><a href="#Footnote_585" class="fnanchor">[585]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Pitt's letter
to the

<p>The next day (1 Dec.) he wrote to the lord
mayor, urging him to lay the matter before the
Common Council;&mdash;"The repeated proofs which the
citizens of London have given of their zeal and
public spirit leave me no doubt that if it appears
likely to promote the interests of the country at
this important crisis, it will receive their cheerful
support in their individual capacity, as well as that
of the corporate body and of the different public
companies. It is unnecessary for me to state the
effect which such an example would produce
throughout the kingdom." To this the mayor
(Brook Watson) replied that previous to the receipt
of the letter he had been desired by a number of members
to call a Common Council as soon as possible to
consider the grant of an aid to government at the
present crisis, and that he had in consequence summoned
a court for the following Monday (5 Dec.).<a name="FNanchor_586" id="FNanchor_586"></a><a href="#Footnote_586" class="fnanchor">[586]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">The loan

<p>For once the Corporation found themselves left
in the lurch. Long before the time named for the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span>Common Council to consider Pitt's proposal the
directors of the Bank of England had met, public
subscriptions had been invited, and the whole loan of
eighteen millions had been subscribed. Here is an
account by a contemporary writer of the scene
witnessed in the Bank on Thursday, the 1st
December, and two following days<a name="FNanchor_587" id="FNanchor_587"></a><a href="#Footnote_587" class="fnanchor">[587]</a>;&mdash;"At ten
o'clock this morning [1 Dec.] the parlour doors
were opened, before which time the lobby was
crowded. Numbers could not get near the books
at all; while others, to testify their zeal, called to
the persons at the books then signing to put down
their names for them, as they were fearful of being
shut out. At about twenty minutes past eleven
the subscription was declared to be completely full,
and hundreds in the room were reluctantly obliged
to go away. By the post innumerable orders came
from the country for subscriptions to be put down,
scarcely one of which could be executed. And long
after the subscription was closed persons continued
coming, and were obliged to depart disappointed.
It is a curious fact, and well worth stating, that the
subscription completely filled in fifteen hours and
twenty minutes: two hours on Thursday, six ditto
on Friday, six ditto on Saturday and one ditto and
twenty minutes on Monday&mdash;fifteen hours and
twenty minutes." The directors of the Bank subscribed
one million in their corporate capacity and
&pound;400,000 individually. The Common Council finding
themselves left out in the cold, scarcely knew what to
do. At first a somewhat pompous proposal was made
for a committee to "prepare a plan for assisting the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span>exigencies of the state in the present conjuncture."
This, however, fell through, and the court finally
contented itself with voting a sum of &pound;100,000 towards
the loan.<a name="FNanchor_588" id="FNanchor_588"></a><a href="#Footnote_588" class="fnanchor">[588]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">The City and

<p>Pitt's method of disposing of public money, when
he got it, was not always approved by the citizens,
more especially when it went to subsidise foreign
mercenaries, without any authority from Parliament.
Here, again, the livery and the Common Council
entertained opposite views, and whilst the former
called upon the city members to move or support a
motion for censuring the ministry for sending money
to the Emperor of Germany during the sitting of
Parliament without the consent of Parliament,<a name="FNanchor_589" id="FNanchor_589"></a><a href="#Footnote_589" class="fnanchor">[589]</a> the

<div class="sidenote">Suspension

<p>The constant drain of gold to the continent under
Pitt's administration again began to affect the Bank
of England as it had formerly done in 1793. On the
previous occasion the difficulty had been got over by
the issue of Exchequer Bills. Since that time the
financial state of the country had been going from
bad to worse. A run on country banks set in,
resulting in demands being made on the Bank of
England, which threatened to exhaust its reserve.
At this crisis the Bank applied to the government.
Pitt, with his usual promptitude, summoned a council,
although it was Sunday (26 Feb., 1797), and a proclamation
was issued suspending cash payments until
Parliament should decide what should be done. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span>next day a meeting of the leading merchants of the
city was held at the Mansion House under the
presidency of the lord mayor. They at once grasped
the situation, and unanimously consented to accept
bank-notes as legal tender.<a name="FNanchor_591" id="FNanchor_591"></a><a href="#Footnote_591" class="fnanchor">[591]</a> The Order in Council
was subsequently approved by Parliament, and though
intended only as a temporary expedient, the Act then
passed continued in operation for twenty-two years,

until May, 1819.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Naval victory

<p>At a time when England seemed on the verge
of bankruptcy, she seemed also likely to lose her
supremacy at sea. A plan was set on foot for a
junction of the French and Spanish fleets, whereby
an overwhelming force might be brought into the
English Channel and an invasion rendered comparatively
easy. Both the king and the citizens expressed
the greatest confidence in the navy,<a name="FNanchor_592" id="FNanchor_592"></a><a href="#Footnote_592" class="fnanchor">[592]</a> although there
were not wanting signs of discontent among the seamen.
Fortunately the Spanish fleet was intercepted by Sir
John Jervis off Cape St. Vincent; the British sailors
forgot their grievances in the presence of the enemy,
and a signal victory was won (14 Feb.), for which
Jervis received the thanks of the City and a sword of
honour, whilst Nelson and others serving under him
were voted the Freedom and gold boxes.<a name="FNanchor_593" id="FNanchor_593"></a><a href="#Footnote_593" class="fnanchor">[593]</a></p>

Again, they drew up an address to the king demanding
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span>the instant dismissal of his ministers, and once
more they made an attempt to get their address
received by the king on the throne. The king,
however, stood out, and all that the livery could do
was to pass resolutions in their Common Hall to the
effect that they had always possessed the privilege
they claimed, and that it had never been questioned
"except under the corrupt and infamous administration"
of those who were responsible for the

<p>All immediate danger from the foreign enemy

assured of a remedy they returned to their duty.
No sooner was one mutiny quelled, however, than
another broke out at the Nore and threatened danger
to London. The two movements were entirely
distinct, and the sailors at Spithead expressed their
strong disapproval of the conduct of their fellow
seamen at the Nore. The danger was none the less.
The Common Council resolved (6 June) to form
ward associations for the defence of the city, but
only one association, viz., the "Cornhill Military

was the day fixed for the ceremony, and on that day
the king and queen, the royal family, the cabinet

and a large body of naval officers and seamen came
in solemn procession to the city, being met at Temple

Common Council.<a name="FNanchor_598" id="FNanchor_598"></a><a href="#Footnote_598" class="fnanchor">[598]</a> The gallant Duncan received an

<div class="sidenote">Dispute as to
command
of London
militia,
1797-1798.</div>

<p>The occasion caused a re-opening of the question
as to the command of the London militia. Was the
command vested in the lord mayor or in the Court of
Lieutenancy?<a name="FNanchor_600" id="FNanchor_600"></a><a href="#Footnote_600" class="fnanchor">[600]</a> The latter body had claimed to have
the disposition of troops brought into the city to
keep order on thanksgiving day. The lord mayor
conceived such a claim to be opposed to his own
prerogative, and he at once communicated with the
Duke of York desiring his royal highness to order up
the regiment of militia then quartered at Greenwich,
and to place it for the day under his (the mayor's)
command, and that had accordingly been done.<a name="FNanchor_601" id="FNanchor_601"></a><a href="#Footnote_601" class="fnanchor">[601]</a> The
question whether the lord mayor, for the time being,
could on his own individual responsibility, and without
consulting the Court of Lieutenancy, call out the
London militia except in cases of emergency, was
afterwards submitted to the law officers of the City,
and they unanimously pronounced an opinion in
favour of the lord mayor's contention.<a name="FNanchor_602" id="FNanchor_602"></a><a href="#Footnote_602" class="fnanchor">[602]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Military
associations
in the city,
1798.</div>

<p>Except for the naval victories of Jervis and
Duncan the year 1797 had been one of the darkest in
the nation's history. The war had lasted over four
years, and although it had already added a hundred
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span>and thirty-five millions to the National Debt, Pitt
found it necessary early in 1798 to make another
appeal to the country for a voluntary loan. Determined
not to be behindhand again, the Common
Council at once resolved (13 Feb.) to subscribe
&pound;10,000; but the money had to be borrowed.<a name="FNanchor_603" id="FNanchor_603"></a><a href="#Footnote_603" class="fnanchor">[603]</a> A
third invasion was threatening under the command of
Napoleon Bonaparte himself. The Duke of York
sent for the lord mayor to learn what military
associations had been formed in the city, and was
disappointed to find that only one existed (viz., the
Cornhill Military Association just mentioned), and
even that had threatened to dissolve itself when it
found the rest of the city wards doing nothing. It
now resolved, however, to put itself into active training.
In April Secretary Dundas wrote more than
once to the lord mayor urging the necessity of forming
as many military associations as possible. The
municipal authorities and the Court of Lieutenancy
buried their differences, and vied with each other in
inspiring the inhabitants of the city with military
ardour. The Ph&oelig;nix Fire Office offered its firemen
for military training, and every effort was made to
bring the militia regiments up to their full strength.<a name="FNanchor_604" id="FNanchor_604"></a><a href="#Footnote_604" class="fnanchor">[604]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">The Battle of

<p>Instead of making a descent on England Bonaparte
sailed to Egypt, seizing Malta on his way, and
there he was forced to remain, owing to the destruction
of his transports by Nelson at the battle of the Nile
(1 Aug.). Nelson, a freeman of the City, presented
to the Corporation the French admiral's (Blanquet)
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span>sword, which lies in the Guildhall Museum.<a name="FNanchor_605" id="FNanchor_605"></a><a href="#Footnote_605" class="fnanchor">[605]</a> The
Corporation, on their part, presented Nelson with a
sword of honour, and Captain Berry with the Freedom

thanks to the officers and men engaged in the action,
and contributed the sum of &pound;500 for the relief of the
widows and orphans of those who had fallen.<a name="FNanchor_606" id="FNanchor_606"></a><a href="#Footnote_606" class="fnanchor">[606]</a> The
City further proposed to erect a suitable memorial of
Nelson's victory. Several suggestions were offered.
Copley recommended pictures to hang in the Council
Chamber opposite his siege of Gibraltar, others were in
favour of sculpture.<a name="FNanchor_607" id="FNanchor_607"></a><a href="#Footnote_607" class="fnanchor">[607]</a> All suggestions were set aside,
however, when it became known that a national
memorial, in the shape of a Grand Naval Pillar, or
<i>Rostra</i>, to be set up on Portsdown Hill, was proposed,
and subscriptions invited. The Common Council at
once resolved to subscribe 100 guineas to the fund.<a name="FNanchor_608" id="FNanchor_608"></a><a href="#Footnote_608" class="fnanchor">[608]</a>
Contributions, however, came in so slowly that the
idea of a national monument had to be abandoned,
and subscriptions were returned, the City's 100 guineas
being paid over to the Marine Society by order of the
Common Council.<a name="FNanchor_609" id="FNanchor_609"></a><a href="#Footnote_609" class="fnanchor">[609]</a> On the 17th January (1799) the
Honourable Mrs. Damer, a daughter of General
Conway, and a clever artist, offered to execute a
bust of Nelson for the Corporation, either in bronze
or marble, in commemoration of his recent victory.
The offer was gracefully made and no less gracefully
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span>accepted;<a name="FNanchor_610" id="FNanchor_610"></a><a href="#Footnote_610" class="fnanchor">[610]</a> and the City's Art Gallery is enriched by

<div class="sidenote">Pitt's Income
Tax Bill,
3 Dec., 1798.</div>

<p>Soon after Parliament met in November (1798)
Pitt introduced his financial scheme for the coming
year. The principal feature of this scheme was a Bill
for imposing a tax upon all the leading branches of
income. The tax was professedly of a temporary
character and was to be employed solely to meet the
exigencies of the war. Some little opposition was
made to the Bill both before and after it passed, as
well in the city as in Parliament. The Common
Council objected to it on the ground that it drew no
distinction between the precarious and fluctuating
income arising from labour, trade and professions and
the more settled income arising from landed and
funded property. They were afraid also that unless
the assessors were bound to secrecy a man's credit
might be unduly prejudiced.<a name="FNanchor_612" id="FNanchor_612"></a><a href="#Footnote_612" class="fnanchor">[612]</a> In spite of all opposition
the Bill passed the Commons by a large majority
on the last day of the year, and early in 1799 was
accepted by the Lords.</p>

<p>In the meantime the situation of Bonaparte and

become very critical. To complete his scheme
of Eastern conquest Bonaparte had marched into
Syria. After capturing Joppa, where he massacred
his prisoners, he advanced to Acre, the key of Syria.
There he was met by Sir Sidney Smith, who
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span>succeeded in throwing himself into the town, and at

<p>On the 21st June (1799) the king himself came
to the City, accompanied by the Dukes of York,
Gloucester, Kent and Cumberland, and officers of the
Life Guards, for the purpose of reviewing the several
volunteer corps of the City, drawn up in Bridge
Street, Blackfriars, at St. Paul's, the Bank, the Royal
Exchange and on Tower Hill. The royal party were
met on the south side of Blackfriars Bridge, where
the City's jurisdiction commenced, by the mayor,
sheriffs and city marshals on horseback, followed by
the grenadiers of the East Regiment of London
militia. The ceremony of delivering the City's sword
into the king's hands having been gone through, the
inspection of the regiments took place. The royal
party afterwards repaired to Finsbury to hold an
inspection of the Artillery Company in their own
ground;<a name="FNanchor_615" id="FNanchor_615"></a><a href="#Footnote_615" class="fnanchor">[615]</a> and in Sun Street, the limit of the City's

<div class="sidenote">Capture of the

<p>Pitt, in the meanwhile, though failing in health,

the hands of Sir Ralph Abercromby and Admiral
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span>Mitchell. A series of reverses, however, quickly
followed, and before the end of November the allied
forces, English and Russians, were glad to accept
terms and quit Holland. Some members of the
Common Council were for presenting a strongly
worded address to the king demanding an enquiry
into the cause of the failure of the expedition, and
the punishment of the authors, but the motion was
eventually allowed to drop.<a name="FNanchor_617" id="FNanchor_617"></a><a href="#Footnote_617" class="fnanchor">[617]</a> The Council had

<div class="sidenote">French

<p>As soon as Bonaparte heard of the new coalition
that had been formed against him he hurried to Paris,
leaving his army behind him in Egypt to shift for

an end to the Directory, and in getting himself
appointed First Consul. He was now practically
supreme, and on his own responsibility made overtures
to England for peace. These overtures were
declined, to the great disappointment of the livery of
London, who again petitioned Parliament against the
prolongation of the war, which had been undertaken,
they said, for no other purpose than for restoring the
Bourbon family to the throne.<a name="FNanchor_619" id="FNanchor_619"></a><a href="#Footnote_619" class="fnanchor">[619]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">The Act of
Union, 1800.</div>

<p>The disaffection that had so long manifested
itself in Ireland led at last to the passing of an Act of
Union. The subject was brought before Parliament
by the king on the 2nd April (1800). A Bill was
subsequently introduced and read a first time on the
17th June. On the 24th it passed the Commons.<a name="FNanchor_620" id="FNanchor_620"></a><a href="#Footnote_620" class="fnanchor">[620]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span></p>

<p>The assent of the Irish Parliament was necessary for
the scheme to take effect. This occasioned some
difficulty, but by a wholesale system of bribery and
corruption, such as was only too common in those
days, it was at last obtained, and it was agreed that
the union of Great Britain and Ireland should commence
from the 1st January, 1801. Thenceforth
there was to be but one Parliament for the two
countries.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Bread riots in
the city,
15-20 Sept.,
1800.</div>

<p>In the meantime distress in England had been
increasing to an alarming extent owing to the bad
harvests and the consequent scarcity of wheat. At
the commencement of the year (1800), the price
of flour had risen to such an extent that the Court
of Aldermen resolved to enforce the consumption of
the standard wheaten bread according to the Statute
(13 Geo. III, c. 62).<a name="FNanchor_621" id="FNanchor_621"></a><a href="#Footnote_621" class="fnanchor">[621]</a> As time went on matters
became worse. In September the city was threatened
with riot. On the night of Saturday the 13th, the
following placard was stuck upon the Monument<a name="FNanchor_622" id="FNanchor_622"></a><a href="#Footnote_622" class="fnanchor">[622]</a>:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Bread will be sixpence the quartern loaf if
the people will assemble at the Corn Market on
Monday.</p>

<p>"Fellow countrymen.</p>

<p>"How long will ye quietly and cowardly suffer
yourselves to be thus imposed upon and half starved
by a set of mercenary slaves and government
hirelings; can you still suffer them to proceed in
their extensive monopolies and your families are
crying for food? No, let them exist not a day
longer. Ye are the sovereignty. Rouse then from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span>your lethargy and meet at the Corn Market,
Monday."</p>

<p>As soon as the attention of the lord mayor
(Harvey Combe) was drawn to the placard, he
forthwith took steps to put down any disturbance
that might arise. The city constables were posted in
the neighbourhood of the Corn Market. The West
Regiment of the city militia was held ready for action
under the command of Alderman Newnham, at their
head-quarters in the Old Bailey, whilst the South-East
Division of Loyal London Volunteers under the
command of Alderman Curtis took up its station
at Fishmongers' Hall. The fact of inflammatory
papers having appeared posted on the Monument,
and the steps he had thus taken to prevent disturbance,
were duly reported by the mayor to the Duke of
Portland, who signified his approval of the chief
magistrate's conduct.<a name="FNanchor_623" id="FNanchor_623"></a><a href="#Footnote_623" class="fnanchor">[623]</a> At eleven o'clock on Monday
morning word was brought to the lord mayor that a
crowd had collected at the Corn Market in Mark
Lane, and that business was impeded. He immediately
set out, accompanied by Alderman Hibbert,
for Mark Lane. At the Corn Market they were
joined by Sir William Leighton and Sheriff Flower.
Finding a large number of people assembled who had
no business in the Corn Market, his lordship ascended
the staircase and proceeded to address the assembly,
entreating them to go home, as that was the best
way of getting rid of their grievance. Thereupon he
was met with loud cries of "bread, bread, give us
bread, and don't starve us!" On the whole, the mob<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span>
appeared fairly good tempered and cheered the
mayor as he left for the Mansion House. In the
afternoon, however, his presence was again required,
and the Riot Act had to be read. Still nothing very
serious occurred; one man suspected of being connected
with the corn trade received rough treatment
at the hands of the mob, and a few rioters were
committed by the mayor to the Compter for
attacking the city marshal with bludgeons, but
matters soon quieted down and the mayor again
returned to the Mansion House to write a report
of the day's doings to the Duke of Portland as
before. Whilst thus occupied, he was again sent for.
This was at half-past six in the evening. As the
mob were at that time beginning to display signs of
mischief, he sent to Colonel Newnham to have his
men ready at a moment's warning, whilst he drew
the volunteers from Fishmongers' Hall, and with their
assistance succeeded in clearing the whole of Mark
Lane and guarding its approaches. The East India
Volunteers, the Bishopsgate Volunteers, and the
Portsoken also rendered assistance. In the course
of the evening the Loyal London Volunteers were
relieved by the militia; but nothing serious happened,
and at one o'clock in the morning the troops were
withdrawn.</p>

<p>On Tuesday (16 Sept.) the lord mayor gave a

caused advertisements to be published offering a
reward of &pound;100 for the apprehension and conviction
of the person or persons who had written or caused

vote of thanks to the mayor for what he had done.
They also placed on record their opinion that, but for
business in the Corn Market being hindered by the
mob, the price of wheat and flour would have
experienced a greater fall than it actually had done
on the 15th, and further, that as nothing would more
tend to the reduction of the existing high price of the
principal articles of food than the affording protection
to dealers bringing corn and other commodities to the
market, the Court was resolved at once and by force
(if necessary) to put down any attempt to impede the
regular business of the markets of the metropolis.<a name="FNanchor_626" id="FNanchor_626"></a><a href="#Footnote_626" class="fnanchor">[626]</a></p>

<p>Whilst the mayor was presiding over the Court
of Aldermen a letter was placed in his hands from the
Duke of Portland, informing him that the duke had
instructed Colonel Herries, commanding the London
and Westminster light horse volunteers, to lose no
time in placing his services at the lord mayor's
disposal. The duke at the same time seemed to
suggest that the lord mayor had been somewhat
remiss in apprehending the ringleaders in yesterday's
disturbances.<a name="FNanchor_627" id="FNanchor_627"></a><a href="#Footnote_627" class="fnanchor">[627]</a> The mayor sent a reply that evening.
He thanked the duke for his offer of assistance; but
he had no occasion for it, as the city was perfectly
quiet. As to his grace's suggestion that the arrest of
some of the ringleaders might have been useful, the
mayor begged to inform him that four of them had
been arrested, and had been committed for trial. If
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span>his grace thought that their prosecution by the crown
would be more efficacious than by the city, he would
forward the minutes of evidence that had been taken.
The letter concluded by an assurance that at the time
of writing (5 p.m.) the mayor had not the smallest
intimation of any disorder in any part of the city.<a name="FNanchor_628" id="FNanchor_628"></a><a href="#Footnote_628" class="fnanchor">[628]</a></p>

<p>Notwithstanding the apparent tranquillity of the

he had already massed troops in Drapers' Hall Gardens
and at the Royal Exchange, whilst he had given orders
to Colonel le Mesurier to hold the Artillery Company
in readiness in the Artillery House. The colonel
thought fit to disobey orders&mdash;to the mayor's great
indignation&mdash;and on his own responsibility marched
150 men to Bishopsgate Street, and sent orders for a
party of the light horse to follow him. The troops
continued to parade the streets until nearly one o'clock
in the morning, when all fear of a disturbance having
passed away, they were withdrawn for the night, and
the mayor went home to write another report to the
Duke of Portland.<a name="FNanchor_629" id="FNanchor_629"></a><a href="#Footnote_629" class="fnanchor">[629]</a> Disturbances continued to occur

He was more indignant when, a few weeks later, the

have not received the slightest information of that
tendency, nor has any one person expressed to me
an apprehension on that head. I should not have
thought it necessary to have made this declaration

<p>The same day that the lord mayor thus addressed

the meeting of Parliament in order to consider the
enormously high price of provisions. To this the
king replied that he was always desirous of recurring
to the advice and assistance of Parliament on any
public emergency, and that previous to receiving the
City's petition he had already given directions for
convening Parliament for the despatch of business.
This was scarcely the reply the City looked for,
and it gave rise to much debate in the Common
Council. When the usual motion was made and
question put that his majesty's gracious answer
should be entered in the Journal of the Court, an
amendment was moved reflecting upon the character
of the answer received as one disrespectful to the

<p>Early in the following year (1801), Pitt resigned.
It had been his intention to introduce a Bill into

Roman Catholics, and thereby to fulfil a pledge he
had given before the Union was effected. The king,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span>however, displayed so much opposition to the proposal,
that Pitt could not do otherwise than send in
his resignation, which the king reluctantly accepted.
The excitement caused by recent events brought on
a recurrence of the king's insanity, and measures were
taken for appointing a regent on the terms formerly
insisted on by Pitt. The king's illness, however,
again proved to be only of a temporary character,

<div class="sidenote">Battle of
Copenhagen,
2 April, 1801.</div>

<p>At sea the British government was no less
successful. A few days after the battle of Alexandria
it became necessary to despatch a fleet to the
Baltic in order to break up a Northern confederacy
formed between Russia, Sweden, and Denmark, which
threatened the interests of this country. The fleet
was placed under the command of Sir Hyde Parker.
Thanks to Nelson's insubordination in declining to
obey the Admiral's signal to discontinue action, the
battle of Copenhagen was won. The Common Council
voted another sum of &pound;500 for the relief of the
wounded and the widows and orphans of those who
had died in the action, but Nelson's name is not
even mentioned.<a name="FNanchor_638" id="FNanchor_638"></a><a href="#Footnote_638" class="fnanchor">[638]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Peace of
Amiens,
27 March,
1802.</div>

<p>Defeated in Egypt, and thwarted in her
Northern policy, France was now willing to accede
to terms, and on the night of the 1st October, Lord
Hawkesbury, foreign secretary, was able to inform
the lord mayor by letter that preliminaries of peace
had been signed that evening. On the 10th, he
wrote again informing the mayor that the preliminaries
had been ratified.<a name="FNanchor_639" id="FNanchor_639"></a><a href="#Footnote_639" class="fnanchor">[639]</a> The news caused
immense satisfaction. Some time, however, was still
to elapse before the final ratification took place.
Negotiations to this end were carried on at Amiens,
and although a number of outstanding questions were
still left unsettled, peace was finally concluded on the
27th March, 1802, and proclaimed in the city on
the 29th April, amid general rejoicing.<a name="FNanchor_640" id="FNanchor_640"></a><a href="#Footnote_640" class="fnanchor">[640]</a> The termination
(as it was thought to be) of a war which left
the British navy "more proudly pre-eminent" than

another of that long series of loyal addresses which

in the course of his long and eventful reign.<a name="FNanchor_641" id="FNanchor_641"></a><a href="#Footnote_641" class="fnanchor">[641]</a></p>

was offered for sale to the Corporation in 1791. The committee to
whom the matter was referred suggested that the City might give
200 guineas for the picture, not so much on account of its intrinsic
merit as because the artist was an industrious and promising man with
a numerous family. This suggestion did not meet with the approval of
the Common Council. It preferred to give the artist half that sum in
acknowledgment of his pains and to allow him to keep the picture.
Whether the artist thought himself thus sufficiently paid for his work is
not clear, but the picture for many years stood in the Long Parlour at
the Mansion House, where it served as a screen. It has recently been
restored, and is now hung in the lobby of the Guildhall.&mdash;Journal 72,

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XLII" id="CHAPTER_XLII">CHAPTER XLII.</a></h2>


<div class="sidenote">Resumption
of hostilities,
May, 1803.</div>

<p>The peace proved to be no more than a temporary
suspension of hostilities, and England's refusal to surrender
Malta, which she had recovered in 1800, and
which she had covenanted by the terms of the treaty
to surrender to France under certain guarantees, served
Napoleon for an excuse to renew the war. On the 12th
May, 1803, Lord Whitworth, the British ambassador,
quitted Paris, where he had been subjected to much
rudeness by the First Consul, and at the same time
the French ambassador was directed to leave London.
Much as the City disliked war, and eager as it had
been for peace, the Common Council were among the
first to express their determination to support the king
and country "against the insatiable ambition of the
French Republic."<a name="FNanchor_642" id="FNanchor_642"></a><a href="#Footnote_642" class="fnanchor">[642]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Defensive
operations.</div>

<p>As soon as war was declared Pitt, after a prolonged
absence in the country, re-appeared in the House, and
in an impassioned speech, lasting two hours and a half,
expatiated upon the justice and necessity of the war.
This took place on the 3rd May. Two months
later (22 July) he urged the House to take measures
for the fortification of London itself:&mdash;"If the
fortification of the capital can add to the security
of the country I think it ought to be done. If by
the erection of works such as I am recommending
you can delay the progress of the enemy for three
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span>days, it may make the difference between the safety
and the destruction of the capital."<a name="FNanchor_643" id="FNanchor_643"></a><a href="#Footnote_643" class="fnanchor">[643]</a> An army
of reserve was already in course of formation, and
on the 28th June the secretary at war (Charles Yorke)
wrote to the lord mayor expressing a hope that a
contingent of 800 men might easily be furnished by
"the first city in the world." The letter having
been laid before the Common Council it was at once
resolved to furnish the quota desired.<a name="FNanchor_644" id="FNanchor_644"></a><a href="#Footnote_644" class="fnanchor">[644]</a> In addition
to this army of reserve, which was to be 50,000 strong,
the militia, to the number of 70,000, were embodied,
whilst 300,000 volunteers were enrolled. In the city
the <i>employ&eacute;s</i> in the Bank of England formed themselves
into a regiment of volunteers, and the Guildhall
became a drill-hall for the various military associations.<a name="FNanchor_645" id="FNanchor_645"></a><a href="#Footnote_645" class="fnanchor">[645]</a>
Besides ten regiments of volunteers and a
cavalry corps, there were associations of River
Fencibles and Harbour Marines. The Common
Council voted two field pieces to the "Loyal London
Cavalry" and colours to the other corps.<a name="FNanchor_646" id="FNanchor_646"></a><a href="#Footnote_646" class="fnanchor">[646]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Renewal of
the Income
Tax.</div>

<p>By way of raising supplies Addington brought
forward a plan for the renewal of the Income Tax,
which had been abolished at the conclusion of the
Peace. The plan involved a distinction between
incomes derived from land and funded property and
incomes derived from the more precarious sources
of trade and commerce&mdash;a distinction previously
advocated by the City&mdash;but Pitt offered so strong an
opposition to the proposal, although beaten on a
division, that Addington gave way.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span></p>
<div class="sidenote">Nelson's
ungraciousness
towards
the City, 1804.</div>

<p>A sharp look-out was kept in the Channel to
prevent the embarkation of the forces gathered on
Boulogne heights, and all French and Dutch ports
were closely blockaded by Cornwallis, Nelson and
other naval commanders, whose services in this
direction were handsomely acknowledged by the
City in March (1804).<a name="FNanchor_647" id="FNanchor_647"></a><a href="#Footnote_647" class="fnanchor">[647]</a> Nelson alone, of all the
officers, showed dissatisfaction, and found fault with
the City, because, forsooth, he had been described as
"blockading" Toulon. Blockading Toulon! he had
been doing "quite the reverse," so he informed
the lord mayor by letter, written on board the
"Victory" the 1st August;&mdash;"Every opportunity had
been offered the enemy to put to sea, for it is there
that we hope to realize the hopes and expectations
of our country, and I trust they will not be disappointed."
Not only did he ungraciously decline
the City's vote of thanks, but he found fault with the
civic authorities for having omitted to pass similar votes
of thanks to Rear-Admiral Sir Richard Bickerton and
Rear-Admiral Campbell, an omission which the writer
imputed to wilful negligence in making proper enquiries.<a name="FNanchor_648" id="FNanchor_648"></a><a href="#Footnote_648" class="fnanchor">[648]</a>
The letter was referred to a committee to consider
and report thereon. As regards the first objection
raised by Nelson, viz., his having been represented as
"blockading" the port of Toulon, the committee
failed to see in this representation, although perhaps
not technically correct, any solid reason for his not
accepting the vote of thanks, more especially as others
who had been similarly employed in different parts of
the world had gladly accepted this mark of the City's
gratitude. The Common Council, however, preferred
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</a></span>to ignore the objection altogether and to let the matter
drop, whilst they tendered a handsome apology to
Rear-Admirals Bickerton and Campbell for having
unwittingly omitted their names in the vote of the
Court of the 26th March.<a name="FNanchor_649" id="FNanchor_649"></a><a href="#Footnote_649" class="fnanchor">[649]</a> This apology, coupled
with an assurance that there did not exist a body of
men in his majesty's dominions more sensible of the
distinguished services of these two officers than the
Corporation of London, was duly transmitted by the
lord mayor to Nelson. That gallant admiral remained,
however, still dissatisfied, and before the close of the
year (27 Dec.) he again wrote from Toulon, complaining
of other omissions on the part of the City,
and recommending that for the future the municipal
authorities should apply to the secretary of the
Admiralty for the names of all officers in fleets
intended to be thanked, and so avoid "such very
unpleasant omissions." This savoured too much of
dictation. The consequence was that instead of
remedying the defect pointed out in the admiral's
letter, the Common Council merely thanked the lord
mayor for having communicated the letter to them.<a name="FNanchor_650" id="FNanchor_650"></a><a href="#Footnote_650" class="fnanchor">[650]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Resignation
of Addington
and recall
of Pitt,
May, 1804.</div>

<p>Meanwhile the state of affairs required a stronger
man at the helm than Addington. There was only
one man equal to the task. That man was Pitt.
Between these two statesmen there was no comparison,
except such as Canning wittily drew:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Pitt is to Addington<br /></span>
<span class="i1">As London is to Paddington."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>For some time past the country had displayed
impatience of Addington's weak ministry and a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</a></span>desire for Pitt's recall; but Addington was loth to
acknowledge his own incompetence and stuck to
office. The prime minister of to-day has happily
hit off Addington's ministerial method in a single
sentence. Addington's father had been a respectable
and respected family physician to Pitt's family, and
the son&mdash;writes Lord Rosebery in his excellent
monograph on Pitt (p. 230)&mdash;"carried into politics
the indescribable air of a village apothecary inspecting
the tongue of the state." More than once
indeed he went so far as to open negotiations with
Pitt through a third party, but the terms offered
were such as Pitt could not possibly entertain without
loss of self respect. Now that England was embarked
on a fresh war, the country became fairly
aroused and the minister was forced to bow to
public opinion and resign (10 May). Pitt undertook
to form a ministry, but was at once confronted with
difficulties from the king. It was Pitt's wish that
the new ministry should be a large and comprehensive
one, embracing both Fox and Grenville, but
the king positively refused to admit Fox, although
he offered no great opposition to Grenville. As
Grenville refused to accept office without his friend,
both were excluded, and Pitt had to form a government
as best he could on a narrow Tory basis.<a name="FNanchor_651" id="FNanchor_651"></a><a href="#Footnote_651" class="fnanchor">[651]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Proceedings
of Common
Council,
19 June, 1804.</div>

<p>Soon after the formation of the new ministry, an
attempt was made in the Common Council (19 June)
to pass a vote of thanks to Addington for his recent
services, but an amendment was proposed to thank
the late minister for having resigned office as soon as
he discovered that he no longer enjoyed the confidence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</a></span>
of the country. The amendment further
expressed regret that the late "partial changes" in
the government appeared so little calculated to
promote the interests of the nation and to secure
the confidence of Parliament and the nation at so
momentous a crisis. Before the amendment, however,
could be put to the vote, it was found that a <i>quorum</i>
was not present, and so "no decision was made
thereon."<a name="FNanchor_652" id="FNanchor_652"></a><a href="#Footnote_652" class="fnanchor">[652]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Review of
city volunteers
at Blackheath,
18 May, 1804.</div>

<p>On the 18th May, Pitt resumed the reins of
government, having submitted himself for re-election
to his constituents at Cambridge. That same day
the First Consul, Pitt's arch enemy, was solemnly
proclaimed sovereign of the French under the title
of the Emperor Napoleon. That same day, too,
witnessed the presentation of colours which the
Common Council had in October last (1803) voted
to the London regiments. The presentation took
place at Blackheath, the lord mayor being conveyed
down the river in the City's state barge,
accompanied by the commander-in-chief and a
brilliant staff of officers, and the troops being conducted
to Greenwich by the River Fencibles. One
officer, viz., Colonel Kensington, commanding the third
regiment of Loyal London Volunteers, declined to
accept the colours, for what reason we are not told.
The ceremony passed off without any accident or
confusion, but a banquet which it was proposed to
give the commander-in-chief and his staff after the
review could not take place in consequence of the
London Tavern being previously engaged, and time<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</a></span>
did not allow of another suitable place being
sought for.<a name="FNanchor_653" id="FNanchor_653"></a><a href="#Footnote_653" class="fnanchor">[653]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Pitt's
Additional
Force Bill,
June, 1804.</div>

<p>It was quite clear that if the country was to
be saved from invasion, the military forces of the
kingdom would still have to be greatly strengthened.
Before consenting to form a ministry, Pitt did not
disguise from the king the serious character of the
situation. "It is in the first place, evident"&mdash;he
wrote to Lord Eldon for communication to the
king&mdash;"that zealous and united as the country
appears to be at this moment [2 May] in its
efforts against the enemy, the present contest may
probably be of very long duration, attended with
great and heavy burdens, and likely to press
severely on the resources and conveniences of all
classes of persons." Filled with these sentiments,
Pitt, as soon as he returned to office, prepared a
measure for the better defence of the country and for
substituting a more permanent military force for the
existing militia. The Additional Force Bill, as this
measure was called, was no sooner laid before the
House than it met with the most strenuous opposition.
The City, according to the provisions of the
Bill, would have had to furnish 1,600 men for military
service, but the Remembrancer, whose business it
is to watch Bills in Parliament affecting the City's
interests, applied to have the clause affecting the
City struck out by an amendment in the House of
Lords, "it having been uniformly the practice for
the city of London to have separate Bills for
such purposes." Two of the city members also<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</a></span>
made similar applications. They were told that the
objection came too late to allow of any omission or
addition being made to the Bill, but that if the Corporation
were desirous of having a separate Bill on this
occasion "they might prepare the same with such
powers for raising the men or money required as
were more consonant to their accustomed forms and
practice."<a name="FNanchor_654" id="FNanchor_654"></a><a href="#Footnote_654" class="fnanchor">[654]</a> In spite of the opposition of Addington,
Sheridan, and Fox, the Bill eventually passed the
Commons by a majority of forty-two, and was carried
up to the Lords. There it was again strongly
opposed and was only carried by a majority of thirty-four.
The City took the advice offered and introduced
a separate Bill on its own account, and this also
passed.<a name="FNanchor_655" id="FNanchor_655"></a><a href="#Footnote_655" class="fnanchor">[655]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Artillery
practice in
Finsbury.</div>

<p>Nothing could exceed the energy of the prime
minister in superintending personally the defences of
the country, and although some of his measures (as
for instance the erection of martello towers along the
south coast and the cutting a canal from Hythe to
Rye) could have done little to check the advance of
the French army had a landing been once effected, the
real value of such measures lay in the confidence and
energy which they excited in the people. Nor were
the citizens less energetic. The Artillery Company
and the London militia, instead of marching out to the
suburbs for practice took to discharging their field
pieces in their own grounds in Finsbury, causing the
houses in the vicinity to shake and windows to be
broken by the concussion. The noise of their discharge
frightened the horses of the frequenters of the City
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</a></span>Road&mdash;the Rotten Row of the East end&mdash;and disturbed
those who had sought ease and quiet, in what was in
those days a respectable if not an aristocratic suburb
of the city. In July (1804) the annoyance became so
great that a formal complaint was made to the Common
Council, who agreed that the practice complained of
should not be continued.<a name="FNanchor_656" id="FNanchor_656"></a><a href="#Footnote_656" class="fnanchor">[656]</a></p>

part inspired with Pitt's enthusiasm, there were not
wanting some who ridiculed the prime minister for
intermeddling in military matters, and for the anxiety
he displayed at the prospect of an invasion which they
thought to be in the highest degree improbable. "Can
he possibly be serious in expecting Bonaparte now!"&mdash;wrote
Grenville to Lord Buckingham on the 25th
August&mdash;although it was well known that Napoleon
had himself gone recently to Boulogne to view the
army that had long been encamped on its heights.
He had even gone so far as to order a medal to be
prepared, bearing the words <i>Frapp&eacute;e a Londres</i>, in
commemoration of his expected conquest. Circumstances
eventually led him to postpone his descent
on the English coast, but the project was far from
abandoned.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Disgrace of
Lord Melville,
April, 1805.</div>

<p>Strong as Pitt was in the country he was weak
in parliament. Before the end of the year (1804) he
sought at once to gratify the king and strengthen his
own position in the House by becoming reconciled with
Addington, who entered the ministry as President of
the Council and was created Viscount Sidmouth. The
coalition lasted, however, but a short time. On the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</a></span>
8th April (1805) Henry Dundas, now Lord Melville
and first lord of the admiralty, was charged with peculation,
and had to stand his trial in Westminster hall.
The lord mayor claimed to have a certain number of
tickets allowed him to witness the trial, on the ground
that a former lord mayor had been allowed them to
witness the trial of Warren Hastings. He experienced,
however, some difficulty in getting them as he could
produce no record of the mayor having established his
claim at the former trial.<a name="FNanchor_657" id="FNanchor_657"></a><a href="#Footnote_657" class="fnanchor">[657]</a> Although the trial resulted
in Melville's acquittal, Pitt could not do otherwise
than advise the removal of his old friend from the
Privy Council. It was a bitter blow and one that he
must have felt the more keenly when he found his
old supporters, the citizens of London, animadverting
in no measured terms upon his friend's conduct and
congratulating the king on his having rid himself and
his councils of so obnoxious a minister.<a name="FNanchor_658" id="FNanchor_658"></a><a href="#Footnote_658" class="fnanchor">[658]</a> The unfortunate
affair again caused an estrangement between
Pitt and Sidmouth, which ended in the latter withdrawing
from the ministry (7 July).</p>

<div class="sidenote">The battle of

<p>Although misfortune continued thus to follow
Pitt in the House, his foreign policy promised well.
Spain it is true had thrown in her lot with France.
On the other hand, Pitt had succeeded in forming a
strong coalition against the Emperor on the continent,
and on the 21st October, Nelson succeeded in vanquishing
the French and Spanish fleets off Cape
Trafalgar, although at the cost of his own life. On
the 13th November, the Common Council drew up
an address to the king, congratulating him upon the

<div class="sidenote">The funeral
of Nelson,
8 and 9 Jan.,
1806.</div>

<p>Nelson's funeral afforded an opportunity for a
solemn water pageant such as has seldom been seen.
On Wednesday, the 8th January (1806) his remains
were borne up the Thames, by barge from Greenwich
to Whitehall, and thence to the Admiralty. The
mayor, aldermen and city officers drove down to
Greenwich after breakfast, and were there received
by Lord Hood. The City's barge had been sent on,
and the barges of the Drapers' Company, the Fishmongers,
the Goldsmiths, the Skinners, the Merchant
Taylors, the Ironmongers, the Stationers and the
Apothecaries were already there. The lord mayor's
barge immediately followed the royal barges and
the barge containing the lords commissioners of the
Admiralty. As the procession made its way up the
river, with a slow hanging stroke befitting the
solemnity of the occasion, minute guns were fired.
The body lay at the Admiralty that night, and the
next day (9 Jan.) was brought to its last resting place in
St. Paul's. The whole of the military arrangements for
keeping the streets of the city were left in the hands
of the lord mayor, and no question as to his authority
was raised, such as had been raised in 1797. On the
other hand, a controversy had arisen as to the position
allotted to the lord mayor in the procession, after
its entrance in the city; the mayor claiming to take
precedence of all subjects of the crown within his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</a></span>own jurisdiction in the city and liberties, whether the
king was present or not. The king was not to attend
on this occasion; nevertheless the mayor claimed
the same precedence as if his majesty were present,
on the ground that in all commissions of gaol delivery
he was named before the chancellor, the judges and
all other subjects whatever. Time did not allow of
the question being fully enquired into at the Heralds'
College, and the difficulty had to be solved by a
special royal warrant to Garter King-at-arms, authorising
him to allot the same place to the lord mayor
that he would have enjoyed had the king himself
been there to receive the City's sword. When the
procession entered the city, the mayor accordingly
took up his position between the carriage of the
Prince of Wales and the funeral car. At the moment
the remains were lowered into the crypt volleys
were fired by the troops, in Moorfields, by signal
given from the gallery on the top of the dome of the
cathedral.<a name="FNanchor_661" id="FNanchor_661"></a><a href="#Footnote_661" class="fnanchor">[661]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Nelson's

<p>The City having resolved to erect a monument to
the deceased admiral, the Hon. Mrs. Damer again
offered her services. Her offer, however, was not
accepted, the Common Council preferring to submit
the matter to public competition. A number of
designs were sent in, one of which was especially recommended
by a committee of so-called experts (not
being themselves artists). This was, however, eventually
rejected on a ballot being taken, and a design
accepted, which proved to be by James Smith, an
artist who had studied under Flaxman, and who had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</a></span>
assisted Mrs. Damer. His estimate of cost was the
lowest of five selected by the committee of experts.<a name="FNanchor_662" id="FNanchor_662"></a><a href="#Footnote_662" class="fnanchor">[662]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Death of Pitt,
23 Jan., 1806.</div>

<p>Although the victory of Trafalgar had established
England's supremacy at sea and had effectually put
an end to Napoleon's project of invasion, the victory
he subsequently gained (2 Dec.) over the allied
forces on the field of Austerlitz, completely shattered
the coalition, and made him all-powerful on the continent.
The shock was too much for Pitt, whose
health had long been failing. Last lord mayor's day,
when news of Nelson's victory and death had recently
arrived, he had attended the banquet at the Guildhall,
but at the cost of much personal suffering.
Once more he was received with acclamation, and
his coach was drawn in triumph. It was for the last
time. When the lord mayor proposed his health as
"the Saviour of Europe," he replied in one of the
shortest, and under the circumstances perhaps one of
the most effective speeches ever delivered on the
occasion by a prime minister:&mdash;"I return you many
thanks," he said, addressing the mayor, "for the
honour you have done me; but Europe is not to be
saved by any single man. England has saved herself
by her exertions and will, I trust, save Europe
by her example."<a name="FNanchor_663" id="FNanchor_663"></a><a href="#Footnote_663" class="fnanchor">[663]</a> With only these two sentences&mdash;the
last words spoken by him in public&mdash;Pitt sat
down. A month later (7 Dec.) he set out for Bath,
and there he received the fatal news. From that day
his health rapidly declined. He recovered sufficiently
to be removed to a house he had hired at Putney, but
on the 23rd January he died.</p>

<div class="sidenote">His funeral,
22 Feb., 1806.</div>

<p>A month later (22 Feb.) the deceased statesman,
whose praises Canning had sung as "The pilot that
weathered the storm," was laid to rest in Westminster
Abbey. The City expressed no wish, as at his father's
death, to be present in their corporate capacity, but
the lord mayor attended in state, and that there
might not be wanting in after years (as in the case
of Hastings's trial), a record of his attendance and
of the precedence allotted him on this occasion, he
caused the facts to be entered in the minutes of the
Court of Aldermen.<a name="FNanchor_664" id="FNanchor_664"></a><a href="#Footnote_664" class="fnanchor">[664]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Pitt's

<p>In the meantime (6 Feb.) a motion had been
made in the Common Council to erect a monument
in the Guildhall to the late minister. After long
debate, the motion was carried, but only by a majority
of six votes. A ward committee was thereupon
appointed to carry the same into execution. On the
28th, an attempt was made to stop all further proceedings,
but the court after further debate, decided
otherwise, and unanimously resolved that the committee
should submit such models and designs as they
might think worthy, together with estimates of
expense. On the 18th September, five models were
submitted to the Common Council,<a name="FNanchor_665" id="FNanchor_665"></a><a href="#Footnote_665" class="fnanchor">[665]</a> the estimates
varying from &pound;3,675 to &pound;5,500. Eventually, the
lowest estimate was selected. The artist who had
sent in the model at this estimate, proved to be
J.G. Bubb, of whom little is known, except that he
carved the sculptures in front of the Custom House,
and modelled the figures adorning the fa&ccedil;ade of the
Opera House, in the Haymarket, recently pulled
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</a></span>down. The monument occupied the artist for more
than six years, and it was not set up in the Guildhall
until 1813. The inscription, written by Canning, bears
testimony to the affectionate regret with which the
City of London cherished Pitt's memory.</p>

<div class="sidenote">City address
to the king,
19 Feb., 1806.</div>

<p>Upon the formation of a new ministry with
Grenville as prime minister, and Fox as foreign
secretary, the Common Council presented an address
to the king, offering their sincere thanks and congratulations
"on the formation of an administration, combining
men of the highest consideration and talents"&mdash;the
administration was known as "the ministry of
all the talents"; they hoped that by such an union
of wisdom and energy in his majesty's councils, a
policy of "vigour, vigilance, and economy" would
be pursued, and they promised the king the City's
support in every demand necessary for resisting the
unreasonable pretensions of Napoleon and for effecting
a permanent and honourable peace.<a name="FNanchor_666" id="FNanchor_666"></a><a href="#Footnote_666" class="fnanchor">[666]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">The City and
Sir Home
Popham, 1806.</div>

<p>Whilst Napoleon was bent on forming on the
continent a western empire, England succeeded in
securing the sea route to India by the re-capture of
the Cape of Good Hope from the Dutch. The
importance of this exploit by the British navy, under
the command of Sir Home Popham, was misconceived
by the City, and a vote of thanks to Popham moved
in the Common Council was lost. The capture of
Buenos Ayres, on the other hand, by the same officer,
was welcomed by them with extravagant joy as
opening a new source of commerce to British manufacturers,
and the Common Council not only accorded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</a></span>
Popham and the fleet a vote of thanks, but voted
that officer a sword of honour of the value of 200
guineas.<a name="FNanchor_667" id="FNanchor_667"></a><a href="#Footnote_667" class="fnanchor">[667]</a> Yet Buenos Ayres was shortly afterwards
lost and never recovered, whereas the Cape still
remains one of the most valuable possessions of the
country.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Battle of
Maida, 3 July,
1806.</div>

<p>The only military success of the Grenville ministry
besides the conquest of the Cape of Good Hope,
was gained in the south of Italy, where Sir John
Stuart beat the French general Regnier at Maida.
The victory was the more welcome, because it proved
to the world that "the boasted prowess" of the
French could not stand against well disciplined British
soldiers when fairly put to the test. The Common
Council, ever ready to recognise merit, voted Stuart
the Freedom of the City and a sword.<a name="FNanchor_668" id="FNanchor_668"></a><a href="#Footnote_668" class="fnanchor">[668]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Fall of the
Grenville
ministry,
March, 1807.</div>

<p>The Grenville ministry did not last long. It
showed a singular inaptitude for war, but it fell on the
question of Catholic emancipation, the same question
that had caused Pitt to resign in 1801. In consideration
of the king's increasing age and bad health,
Fox had given his word immediately on assuming
office, not to bring the question forward. Fox died
in September, 1806, and early the following year
Grenville, who had given no such pledge, notified his
intention of bringing forward a Bill for throwing open
all ranks of the army and navy to Catholics and
Protestants alike. The king looked upon any assent
that he might give to Catholic emancipation as nothing
less than an infringement of his coronation oath, and
he conscientiously and consistently opposed every
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</a></span>measure tending in that direction. A certain section
of the Common Council was also opposed to the Bill
as subversive of the constitution, but a motion to
move parliament against the Bill was rejected.<a name="FNanchor_669" id="FNanchor_669"></a><a href="#Footnote_669" class="fnanchor">[669]</a> Not
satisfied with the withdrawal of Grenville's Bill the
king in his morbid sensibility, insisted upon a promise
that he would never bring forward a similar measure
again&mdash;a promise that no constitutional minister
could give. Thereupon he was summarily dismissed
(March, 1807), and the Duke of Portland became
nominally prime minister, although the leadership
was virtually assumed by Spencer Perceval.</p>

<div class="sidenote">City address,
22 April, 1807</div>

<p>Once more the "successors of the Roundheads"
congratulated the king upon his having vindicated
"the glorious independence of the crown." Owing to
the state of the king's health, and more particularly his
defective eyesight, the City waived its right to present
the address on the throne; and only a deputation of
the Common Council was present.<a name="FNanchor_670" id="FNanchor_670"></a><a href="#Footnote_670" class="fnanchor">[670]</a> A dissolution

not only the City but the country supported the

<div class="sidenote">The Berlin

<p>Having devastated the continent to such an

called upon to contribute towards the alleviation
of the prevalent distress,<a name="FNanchor_671" id="FNanchor_671"></a><a href="#Footnote_671" class="fnanchor">[671]</a> the Emperor had recently
aimed a direct blow at England by issuing the famous
Berlin Decree (21 Nov., 1806), forbidding all intercourse
with this country, and confiscating all English
merchandise found on the continent. This was the
commencement of the "continental system" which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</a></span>ultimately proved more injurious to Napoleon himself
than to England.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Napoleon
and Spain,

<p>The system was accepted everywhere except in
Portugal, and Napoleon, who had long fixed his eyes
on the Peninsula, seized the opportunity afforded by
Portugal refusing to close its ports to England to
wage war not only upon that country but upon
Spain. The city of London became more than ever
alive to the danger which threatened this country
from the "vast gigantic confederacy" established
mainly for the destruction of England, and the
citizens set an example, as the king himself graciously
acknowledged (30 March, 1808), "of union and
public spirit" at this important crisis.<a name="FNanchor_672" id="FNanchor_672"></a><a href="#Footnote_672" class="fnanchor">[672]</a> When

who formally offered their thanks to the king for
granting his protection and support to a "high-minded

the king's solemn recognition of the Spanish nation
as a friend and ally against "the common enemy
of all established governments"&mdash;as they styled

<p>A force was despatched to Portugal under the

had he achieved some success than he found himself
superseded by Sir Harry Burrard, who in turn had to
give place to Sir Hugh Dalrymple. The consequence
was, that the good accomplished by one commander
was quickly undone by another, and in August a
Convention&mdash;known as the Convention of Cintra&mdash;was
signed, and the French army was allowed to return
home scot free. This raised a storm of indignation
among the citizens, and the king to pacify them
promised an enquiry. He little liked, however, the
City's interference in the matter, and said so:&mdash;"I
should have hoped"&mdash;he told the Common Council
who waited upon him&mdash;"that recent occurrences
would have convinced you, that I am at all times
ready to institute enquiries on occasions in which
the character of the country or the honor of my
arms is concerned; and that the interposition of the
city of London could not be necessary for inducing
me to direct due enquiry to be made into a transaction
which has disappointed the hopes and
expectations of the nation."<a name="FNanchor_675" id="FNanchor_675"></a><a href="#Footnote_675" class="fnanchor">[675]</a> Wellesley and his

to give an account of their conduct, the command of

<div class="sidenote">Scandal of
the Duke
of York,
1809.</div>

<p>The Convention of Cintra and the retreat of
Sir John Moore, successful as that retreat had been,
although costing him his own life, discouraged the
government which now was called upon to meet an
attack from another quarter. Early in the spring
of 1809, the Duke of York, commander-in-chief, was
charged by a militia colonel named Wardle, member
for Okehampton, with having allowed his mistress,
Mrs. Clarke, to dispose of commissions, and having
himself participated in the proceeds of this nefarious
traffic. The scandal was aggravated by a public
investigation before the entire House of Commons,
and although the duke was eventually acquitted of
personal corruption, he felt compelled to resign his
post. His acquittal disgusted the Common Council,
who desired to place on record their belief that it was
greatly due to that "preponderating influence" of
which they had formerly complained. On the other
hand they voted Wardle the Freedom of the City in a
gold box (6 April).<a name="FNanchor_676" id="FNanchor_676"></a><a href="#Footnote_676" class="fnanchor">[676]</a> In the course of a few months
Wardle was himself sued by a tradesman for the
price of goods with which he had furnished a house
for Mrs. Clarke. This put a new aspect on the
charges Wardle had brought and greatly diminished
the feeling against the duke, who was soon afterwards
restored to office. The City, however, still upheld
Wardle, and not only refused to rescind their vote
of the 6th April, but placed on record an elaborate
statement showing how by his means, and in the face
of unexampled threats and difficulties, a system of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</a></span>
"scandalous abuse and corruption, not only in the
army, but in the various departments of the State"

<p>The ministry had scarcely recovered from the
effects of the scandal before it received a fatal shock
from the disastrous failure of the Walcheren expedition,
owing chiefly to senseless disputes between
the naval and military commanders. Canning and
Castlereagh&mdash;the foreign minister and the war minister&mdash;endeavoured
to throw the blame on each
other's shoulders. They both resigned office and
then fought a duel. Their resignation was followed
by that of the Duke of Portland, whose failing health
had from the first rendered him unfit for his position,
and who shortly afterwards died. His place was
taken by Spencer Perceval.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The king's

<p>The City was greatly depressed at the result of

the 50th year of his reign on the 25th October of this

rejoicing at a time when the country was involved in
so much disgrace.<a name="FNanchor_678" id="FNanchor_678"></a><a href="#Footnote_678" class="fnanchor">[678]</a> The majority, however, thought
otherwise, and the City joined with the rest of his
majesty's subjects in offering congratulations. The
citizens could forgive much, if only trade were good,
and as to this they were in a position to assure the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</a></span>king that notwithstanding the unexampled struggles
through which the country had passed since the day
of his accession, its commerce was "flourishing to an
extent unknown in any former war."<a name="FNanchor_679" id="FNanchor_679"></a><a href="#Footnote_679" class="fnanchor">[679]</a> A thanksgiving
service was held in St. Paul's, which the municipal

<p>Before the presentation of the City's address a
special meeting of the livery took place (14 Dec.),
when the original address agreed to by the Common
Council and afterwards discarded was adopted by the
livery as their own, and ordered to be presented to
the king at the next public lev&eacute;e. Then followed
another of those unseemly wrangles we have had so
often to record. When the sheriffs proceeded to
carry out the wishes of the livery they found that for
some years past no public lev&eacute;e had been held owing
to the king's failing eyesight, and when asked to do
as all others did&mdash;with the exception of the corporation
of London and the two Universities&mdash;and to
leave the address with the principal secretary of state,
who would in due course lay it before the king, they
refused.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Resolution of

<p>The matter being reported to the livery (9 Jan.,

condemning the king's advisers, and these the
sheriffs were ordered to deliver "into his majesty's
hands." The secretary of state very naturally objected
to trouble the king any further in the matter,
as there was, in reality, no difference between
presenting an address and presenting resolutions. At
the same time, he signified his willingness to lay a
copy of the resolutions before the king in the manner
adopted since the cessation of public lev&eacute;es. This
offer was refused. An attempt was then made to
have the document presented at a private lev&eacute;e, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</a></span>
the sheriffs wrote a joint letter to the secretary of
state informing him of their intention of attending for
the purpose at the next private lev&eacute;e, unless it should
be his majesty's pleasure to receive them at some
other time and place. To this the secretary replied
that no one was admitted to private lev&eacute;es without
the king's permission; that he had laid their letter
before the king and that his majesty saw no reason
for drawing a distinction between the resolutions and
the address; that had the sheriffs been deputed by
the body corporate of London, his majesty would have
received them differently, but he could not receive

the livery had to content themselves with entering a
formal protest against what they still believed to be
a "flagrant violation of city rights."<a name="FNanchor_683" id="FNanchor_683"></a><a href="#Footnote_683" class="fnanchor">[683]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">The City
opposes
proposed
Wellington's
annuity,
Feb., 1810.</div>

<p>A few weeks later (23 Feb.) when a Bill was
before the House for granting an annuity to Wellesley
(recently created Viscount Wellington for his victory
at Talavera) the Common Council took the matter up
and complained to Parliament of the recent failure of
the livery to get their address received by the king
owing to the misconduct of his majesty's ministers,
who had "placed a barrier between the king and the
people," and whose conduct was now aggravated by
the proposal respecting Wellington, made "in defiance
of public opinion." Whilst petitioning against the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</a></span>
Bill the City assured the House that they did so from
no motives of economy, but from a sense that,
notwithstanding Wellington's indisputable valour, his
military conduct was not deserving national remuneration.
What were the facts? That in the
short period of his service in Europe, not amounting
to two years, they had seen his gallant efforts in
Portugal lead only to the "disgraceful and scandalous"
Convention of Cintra; while in Spain, notwithstanding
his defeat of the French at Talavera, he had been
compelled to retreat and leave his sick and wounded
to the care of the enemy. No enquiry had been
made into either of these campaigns, although it was
but due to the nation that a most rigid investigation
as to why so much valour should have been uselessly
and unprofitably displayed should first take place
before the nation's pecuniary resources should be thus
applied. In India Wellington had received ample
remuneration for his services, and at home he had
held valuable appointments. As for making provision
for his family, none had been made for the family of
Sir John Moore, who had so nobly died.<a name="FNanchor_684" id="FNanchor_684"></a><a href="#Footnote_684" class="fnanchor">[684]</a> This
attitude of the City towards the Bill becomes the
more intelligible when we consider that Wellington
at that time had many enemies, both in and out of
Parliament, and that his military genius had not yet
awakened recognition. When, a year later, it was
found that, owing to his skill, his patient self-reliance
(for he received but little encouragement from the
government at home) and his foresight, not a single
French soldier remained in Portugal, the City, like the
rest of the nation, were ready to acknowledge his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</a></span>
"consummate ability, fortitude and perseverance,"
and presented him with the Freedom and a sword of
honour, despatching at the same time the sum of
&pound;1,000 for the relief of poor Portuguese.<a name="FNanchor_685" id="FNanchor_685"></a><a href="#Footnote_685" class="fnanchor">[685]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Sir Francis
Burdett
committed to
the Tower,
9 April, 1810.</div>

<p>In the spring of this year (1810) the question of
parliamentary reform was (after an interval of
twenty-five years) again brought into prominence
by the committal of Sir Francis Burdett to the
Tower by order of the House of Commons. The
House had recently committed to Newgate a man
named John Gale Jones for having published an
attack on its proceedings, and Sir Francis Burdett
had questioned its right to commit any man to
prison. The consequence was that on the 6th April
a warrant was issued for the committal of Burdett
himself to the Tower. Burdett resisted the warrant
as illegal, and had to be conveyed to the Tower by
an armed force (9 April). The ministry anticipated
a riot, and made application to the lord mayor for
permission to quarter troops in the government storehouses
situate on the banks of the river. The mayor,
in reply, assured the secretary of state, through whom
the application had been made, that the city was
perfectly quiet, but he would consult his brother
aldermen on the matter. The next day&mdash;the day
that Burdett was to be conveyed to the Tower&mdash;he
wrote again to the secretary, assuring him that the
city continued quiet, but that if necessity arose for
military assistance to protect the government stores
he (the mayor) would allow the premises to be
occupied by troops, but only on the express condition<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</a></span>
that they acted under his own directions or the
directions of one of the city marshals.<a name="FNanchor_686" id="FNanchor_686"></a><a href="#Footnote_686" class="fnanchor">[686]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Riots in the
city.</div>

<p>Unfortunately the day did not pass off without
bloodshed. Notwithstanding the care taken to
conduct their prisoner by a circuitous route instead
of by the direct way through Eastcheap to the
Tower, the troops were severely handled by the mob
both going and returning. For a long time the
soldiers exhibited the greatest patience, but at length
they were forced in sheer self-defence to fire, and a
man named Thomas Ebrall was killed and others
wounded. The Court of Aldermen were asked to
offer a reward of &pound;200 for the discovery of the man
who had shot Ebrall, on whose death a jury had
brought in a verdict of wilful murder against a
guardsman, name unknown, but the Court declined.
They instituted an enquiry, however, into the whole
of the proceedings of the day, and after taking
numerous depositions and giving the matter their
best attention they came to the conclusion that the
firing by the soldiers was justified.<a name="FNanchor_687" id="FNanchor_687"></a><a href="#Footnote_687" class="fnanchor">[687]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Petition of the
livery to
Parliament,
4 May, 1810.</div>

<p>The livery in the meanwhile had insisted upon a
special Common Hall being summoned for the purpose
of taking into consideration "the alarming assumption
of privilege by the honourable the House of Commons,
of arresting and imprisoning during pleasure
the people of England, for offences cognisable in the
usual courts of law," and on the 4th May, they
passed a cordial vote of thanks to Burdett for having
resisted the Speaker's warrant, and for having upheld
the right of freedom of speech. They also thanked
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</a></span>the lord mayor for his "constitutional endeavours
to preserve the peace of the city without the aid of
the military." Furthermore, they resolved that the
only means left to save the constitution and the
country was parliamentary reform, which must be
both speedy and radical, and they called upon the
people of the United Kingdom to join them in
endeavouring to bring this reform about. A petition
to the House was then read and adopted, the language
of which was so strong that even the petitioners
themselves felt constrained to offer some kind of
apology, and to declare that by it they intended no
disrespect to the House. After commenting upon
what they deemed an illegal and totally unjustifiable
act of the House, in committing Jones and Burdett
to prison without legal process, they proceeded to
remind the Commons that so far from representing
the people, they were known to have been sent to
Parliament "by the absolute nomination or powerful
influence of about 150 peers and others;" that they
had refused to examine the charge brought against
Lord Castlereagh and Spencer Perceval, two ministers
of the Crown, of trafficking in seats; that when, on a
former occasion, it was averred before the House
"that seats for legislation in the House of Commons
were as notoriously rented and bought as the
standings for cattle at a fair," the House had treated
the assertion with affected indignation, and ministers
had threatened to punish the petitioners for presenting
a scandalous and libellous petition. The petitioners,
nevertheless, had lived "to see a House of Commons
avow the traffick and screen those accused of this
breach of law and right, because it had been equally<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</a></span>
committed by all parties, and was a practice as
notorious as the sun at noon-day." Where, they
asked, was the justice of the House? Where its
dignity? Jones was confined to prison for an alleged
offence which if committed against any subject of the
realm, or even the king himself, would have been
made the subject of legal investigation; Lord Castlereagh
continued to be a principal minister of the
Crown, and was at that very time a free member of
Parliament; Sir Francis Burdett had been dragged
from the bosom of his family and committed to the
Tower, for exercising the right of constitutional discussion,
common and undeniable to all, whilst Spencer
Perceval continued a member of the House, taking a
lead in its deliberations, the first minister of the
Crown, and the chief adviser of the royal council.
There was no need, the petitioners said, to recapitulate
to the House the numerous instances of neglect to
punish public delinquents, to economise the public
money, to obtain redress for the lavish profusion of
blood and money in the late Walcheren expedition.
These and similar proceedings required no comment.
Under these circumstances the petitioners called upon
the House to expunge from its Journal all its orders
respecting Jones and Sir Francis Burdett, and in conjunction
with the latter to adopt such measures as
would effect an immediate and radical parliamentary
reform.<a name="FNanchor_688" id="FNanchor_688"></a><a href="#Footnote_688" class="fnanchor">[688]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">The petition

<p>Such strong language addressed to the Parliament
of the United Kingdom was more than some of the
livery then present in Common Hall could approve
of, and they adjourned to the London Tavern where<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</a></span>
they drew up a formal protest against what they conceived
to be nothing less than an attempt "to degrade
the legislature; to alienate the affections of the people
from the Government, to produce contempt and
distrust of the House of Commons, to introduce
anarchy, and to subvert the constitution." The
petition nevertheless was presented to the House,
but after considerable debate, and after a motion that
it should be allowed to lie on the table had been lost
by a large majority, it was dismissed.<a name="FNanchor_689" id="FNanchor_689"></a><a href="#Footnote_689" class="fnanchor">[689]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Proceedings
of Common
Hall,
21 May, 1810.</div>

<p>The rejection of their petition occasioned the
holding of another Common Hall for the purpose of
maintaining the rights of the livery constitutionally
assembled. As soon as the Hall met (21 May), the
livery proceeded to pass a number of resolutions.
They declared that the recent protest had been
signed by "contractors, commissioners, and collectors
of taxes, placemen, and place-hunters," and that its
object was "the excitement of civil dissension, the
increase of public abuses, and the further and fuller
participation in the wages of corruption," by many
of those who had signed it; that the right of petitioning,
which had been denied to the subject in 1680,
and allowed and confirmed in 1688 by the Bill of
Rights, had again been invaded, and a new race of
<i>Abhorrers</i> had sprung up, and that it behoved every
real friend of the country "to resist their mischievous
designs by recurring to the genuine principles of the
constitution, and by using every legal means for
obtaining a full, fair and free representation of the
people in Parliament." They resolved, notwithstanding
the rejection of their last petition, to give<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</a></span>
the House of Commons every opportunity of hearing
and redressing the grievances of the people, and
sanctioned the presentation of another humble address,
petition and remonstrance. This new petition, which
differed but slightly from the last, was presented to
the House on the 25th, and instead of being rejected,
was ordered to lie on the table.<a name="FNanchor_690" id="FNanchor_690"></a><a href="#Footnote_690" class="fnanchor">[690]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">The Regency
Bill,
Feb., 1811.</div>

<p>The necessity of a regency soon became manifest,
and in January, 1811, a Bill was introduced for the
purpose of appointing the Prince of Wales. When
Pitt introduced a similar Bill in 1788 he had displayed
no little courage in upholding the authority of parliament
and imposing certain restrictions and limitations
upon the regency of the prince whose character was
none of the best, and the City had acknowledged the
wisdom of his policy and passed him a vote of thanks.
At that time it was a matter of uncertainty whether
the king might not recover, as recover he did, and there
was danger of prematurely paying court to the rising
sun. More than twenty years had since passed away.
The king was now an old man and the Prince of
Wales must, in the ordinary course of things, succeed
to the throne before long. Parliament still wished to
impose restrictions upon the regency, but in a more
modified form than in the former Bill. The prince,
however, was adverse to any restrictions and the City
sided with the prince against parliament.<a name="FNanchor_695" id="FNanchor_695"></a><a href="#Footnote_695" class="fnanchor">[695]</a> In spite of
their protest the Bill, with its limitations, was passed
(5 Feb., 1811) and the prince submitted to take the
oaths. A few days later the City offered him an
address of condolence and congratulation, and at the
same time appealed to him for redress of grievances
and more especially for parliamentary reform.<a name="FNanchor_696" id="FNanchor_696"></a><a href="#Footnote_696" class="fnanchor">[696]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">The Freedom

his station as Regent. He made, however, a gracious
reply to the deputation which waited upon him to
learn his pleasure (he declined to receive more than
the lord mayor, the sheriff, the recorder, and the
remembrancer, as being contrary to precedent), and
assured them that it was his earnest desire at all times
to promote the interest and welfare of the ancient

meeting at the

<p>The regency being thus settled the "friends of

1811) to organise a meeting in London. The meeting
was to take place on Whit Monday (3 June) and was
to be attended by delegates from all parts of the kingdom.
The Common Council were disposed to accede
to a request for the use of the Guildhall for the purpose
of the meeting, but upon representation being
made to them by the Court of Aldermen, and by some
of the livery, that such a course would be without

<div class="sidenote">Address of
the livery to
the Regent,
26 Mar., 1812.</div>

<p>As time wore on and the livery who had confessedly
looked upon the regency as the "dawn of a
new era" found their hopes disappointed, no change
being made in the ministry and no reforms carried out,
they resolved to address themselves to the Regent.
They accordingly drew up a petition after their kind,
and appointed a deputation of twenty-one liverymen
to attend its presentation (26 March, 1812). Not a
word was said about the petition being presented to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</a></span>the prince on the throne. When the sheriffs attended
at Carlton House on Wednesday, the 1st April, to
learn when the Regent would be pleased to receive it,
they were told that he would receive it at the lev&eacute;e
on the following Thursday week (9th) in "the usual
way." When asked if he would receive the deputation
appointed by the livery, the prince demurred. There
were "certain forms attending that," but he would
communicate with the secretary of state who would
give them an answer. The next day (2 April), secretary
Ryder informed the sheriffs by letter, that no
persons beyond "the number allowed by law," to
present petitions to his majesty, would be admitted
to the lev&eacute;e on the 9th, except the lord mayor,
aldermen, sheriffs, and city officers. The sheriffs, on
the receipt of this letter again came to the charge and
represented to the secretary of state&mdash;apparently for
the first time, and on their own responsibility&mdash;that
the livery had expected that the Regent would have
received their address on the throne. What, moreover,
did the Regent mean when he said that he would
receive it in "the usual way"? To this query, the
secretary replied that by the words "in the usual way,"
the prince meant "the way in which the petitions of
persons in general were received, and not in which
the addresses or petitions of the livery of London
had been received in some instances previous to the
year 1775." He also added that the address and
petition would not be read at the lev&eacute;e nor would any
answer be given, and, further, that only a deputation
of the livery, not exceeding ten persons, might attend.
On being informed of all this the livery were furious,
but had to content themselves as before, with passing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</a></span>
a number of resolutions against the advisers of the
crown, etc., etc., and these the sheriffs were ordered to

<p>Ten days later (17 April), the Common Council

such a formidable indictment of the government that
it was characterised by his highness (who presumably
received it on the throne) as one that involved "the
total change in the domestic government and foreign
policy of the country." This address did not appear
in the <i>London Gazette</i>, as it ought to have done according
to custom, and upon enquiry as to the reason for this
omission, answer was made that "the <i>London Gazette</i>
was the king's paper," and nothing appeared therein
without the order of government; that no such order
had been received in this case; that nevertheless, as
it had been found to be usual to insert addresses
of the Corporation presented to the king with the
answer thereto, the secretary of state would give
directions for inserting the last address and answer
"on account of the usage," and not as a matter of
right.<a name="FNanchor_700" id="FNanchor_700"></a><a href="#Footnote_700" class="fnanchor">[700]</a></p>

the secretaries of state for further particulars. The
city marshals were immediately ordered to take steps
for calling out the watch and ward, and to report every
half-hour to the Mansion House. All that night a
double patrol was kept, and half-hourly reports sent
in until daylight. At eight o'clock the following

mustered at head-quarters in case of an outbreak,<a name="FNanchor_702" id="FNanchor_702"></a><a href="#Footnote_702" class="fnanchor">[702]</a>
but it soon became known that the outrage was the

not of a political conspiracy as was at first
believed. The assassin was convicted and hanged
within a week. All the ministers resigned, and an
attempt was made to construct a Whig cabinet, but it

<p>The year 1813 found England at war, not only
with France but with America. For some time past
the United States had felt aggrieved at certain Orders
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</a></span>in Council which had been issued by way of retaliation
for the famous Berlin decree; and in contravention of
these orders they had insisted on the doctrine that a
neutral flag made free goods. The orders had been
revoked in favour of America in June, 1812, but the
concession came too late, and war had been declared.
An attempt to draw off Canada from her allegiance
failed, but at sea the Americans succeeded in capturing
some of our frigates. At length, a duel was, by
arrangement, fought outside Boston harbour, between
the English vessel "Shannon," Captain Broke in
command, and the American frigate "Chesapeake."
The vessels were well matched, but the action which
took place on the 1st June (1813), lasted little more
than a quarter of an hour. It was reported at the
time that an explosion took place on the "Chesapeake,"
and that it was owing to this rather than to any
superiority in courage or tactics on the part of the
crew of the English vessel that the American was
made a prize.<a name="FNanchor_705" id="FNanchor_705"></a><a href="#Footnote_705" class="fnanchor">[705]</a> But, however, this may have been,

prohibiting the slave trade, under a penalty of heavy
fines. As this Act was not sufficiently deterrent,
another Act had been passed in 1811, making slave
trading a felony, and so the trade had, after a long
struggle, been finally abolished throughout the British
dominion. Since 1792 the civic fathers do not
appear to have taken any active part in the matter;
but when it became known that the peace had been
concluded, not only without any guarantee against the
revival of the slave trade in parts where it had been
abolished by England, and which were now to be ceded
to France, but with express stipulations that the traffic
should and might be exercised in those parts for a
certain number of years, the City again took the matter
up. A strong petition was drawn up by the Common
Council (4 July), and submitted to both Houses
of Parliament. They expressed the deepest regret
that by such stipulations "all the labours and exertions
of the wise and virtuous in this country, and all the
enactments of the legislature," for the abolition of
the slave trade had been rendered useless and unavailing.
After such a formal recognition in the treaty
of the right of France to carry on the abominable
traffic, it would be preposterous for the British government
to ask the assistance of other powers to put it
down. The petitioners, therefore, humbly prayed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</a></span>
both Houses to take speedy steps to impress upon his
majesty's government the necessity of having the
obnoxious clauses rescinded.<a name="FNanchor_714" id="FNanchor_714"></a><a href="#Footnote_714" class="fnanchor">[714]</a> A week later (11 July)
the prince, who, when originally applied to on the
matter by the House of Commons, had returned
what was then considered a favourable answer, now
assured Parliament that he would endeavour to carry
out its wishes.<a name="FNanchor_715" id="FNanchor_715"></a><a href="#Footnote_715" class="fnanchor">[715]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Battle of
Waterloo,
18 June, 1815.</div>

<p>Early in the following year, whilst a congress
was sitting at Vienna to regulate the affairs of Europe,
news was brought that Napoleon had made his
escape from Elba. Louis XVIII, the restored Bourbon
king, who had already become unpopular, fled to Lille,
and Napoleon became once more emperor of the
French. His reign was, however, cut short on the
field of Waterloo (18 June). The allies entered Paris
in triumph (7 July), Napoleon took refuge on board
the "Bellerophon," a British man-of-war, and claimed
the hospitality of the Prince Regent. It was, however,
only too clear that the peace of Europe would
be constantly menaced were he to be allowed his
liberty. He was, therefore, removed to St. Helena, and
kept under guard. Louis XVIII was again restored,
and negotiations were resumed, which resulted in a
second treaty of Paris (20 Nov.). Once more the City
offered congratulations to the Regent,<a name="FNanchor_716" id="FNanchor_716"></a><a href="#Footnote_716" class="fnanchor">[716]</a> and as the
swords of honour, voted last year to Blucher and
other distinguished foreign officers, had not yet been
presented, the lord mayor (Samuel Birch) proposed
going to Paris himself, with a small deputation of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</a></span>Common Council, and making the presentation&mdash;as
he said&mdash;"in the face of the world." Although he
had received assurances that every possible respect
would be shown him, he eventually abandoned the
idea, and contented himself with despatching the
swords to the Duke of Wellington for delivery to their
respective owners.<a name="FNanchor_717" id="FNanchor_717"></a><a href="#Footnote_717" class="fnanchor">[717]</a></p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XLIII" id="CHAPTER_XLIII">CHAPTER XLIII.</a></h2>


<div class="sidenote">The City
opposes
renewal of
Income Tax,
Feb., 1816.</div>

<p>Now that the war was over, a period of tranquillity,
prosperity and retrenchment was eagerly looked for.
The country therefore experienced bitter disappointment
when, on the resumption of the parliamentary
session in February (<i>1816</i>), the government declared
its intention of continuing to levy the income or property
tax (which, from the first, had been avowedly a
war tax) although the assessment was to be reduced by
one-half. The citizens were among the first to express
their indignation at such a proceeding. The Common
Council and the livery passed a number of resolutions
against the continuance of a tax that was at once
inquisitorial, unjust and vexatious, and both bodies
presented petitions to parliament against its renewal.<a name="FNanchor_718" id="FNanchor_718"></a><a href="#Footnote_718" class="fnanchor">[718]</a>
The Common Council submitted to the House that
having patiently endured great burdens and privations
during a war of unexampled difficulty they had
naturally expected that on the return of peace "they
should have been relieved from the burthens of war
establishments and war taxes, that at least the most
obnoxious and oppressive of them would have been
removed, and they confidently hoped that by such
reductions in the public expenditure with the necessary
reformations and the abolishing of all unnecessary
places, pensions and sinecures, there would have been
no pretence for the continuance of a tax subversive
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</a></span>of freedom and destructive to the peace and happiness
of the people." The livery for their part
reminded the House that the first imposition of the tax
was accompanied by "the most unequivocal and
solemn declaration that the same should be withdrawn
immediately after the termination of the then
existing hostilities," and they expressed the utmost
surprise and indignation at the government proposing
to continue the oppressive and odious tax now that
peace had been restored. As for the proposed reduction
from ten to five per cent. the change so far from
being likely to render the tax less vexatious would
produce the opposite effect, and would, in their opinion,
"be the occasion of the most degrading and inquisitorial
proceedings, worse, if possible, than have been
experienced under the former pressure of this heavy
burden." The outcry of the city was quickly taken
up by the country, and such a flood of petitions
against the renewal of the tax poured in that the
government had to give way and the tax was abandoned.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Agricultural
depression,
1811-1815.</div>

<p>At the opening of the session the Prince Regent
had congratulated the country upon the prosperity of
the revenue and of all branches of trade and manufacture.<a name="FNanchor_719" id="FNanchor_719"></a><a href="#Footnote_719" class="fnanchor">[719]</a>
As a matter of fact both the commercial and
agricultural interests of the country were in a very bad
way. The high prices produced during the latter part
of the war by the continental system, which virtually
excluded foreign competition, had been most disastrous
to agriculture by encouraging a bad system of farming,
whilst they inflicted the greatest hardship upon all but
the wealthiest class. In 1811 the price of a quartern
loaf&mdash;as set from time to time by the Court of Aldermen,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</a></span>
according to the custom of the city,<a name="FNanchor_720" id="FNanchor_720"></a><a href="#Footnote_720" class="fnanchor">[720]</a> "within the city
and the liberties thereof, and the weekly Bills of
mortality, and within ten miles of the Royal
Exchange"&mdash;had risen to such a height that the
Common Council presented an address to the Regent
(18 Dec.) praying him to take measures for re-opening
commercial intercourse with foreign, and especially
neutral, nations. To this the Regent replied that
nothing should be wanting on his part towards restoring
commercial intercourse between this country
and other nations "to the footing on which it has
been usually conducted, even in the midst of war."<a name="FNanchor_721" id="FNanchor_721"></a><a href="#Footnote_721" class="fnanchor">[721]</a>
The average price of the quartern loaf, from this
period until the autumn of 1813, when the country was
blessed with a rich harvest, may be set down at 1<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>
It then began to fall rapidly. Flour, however, kept
up in price for some time owing to the dryness of the
summer, which prevented many mills near London from
working, whilst several of the mills which could work
"were engaged in answering the demands of government
for the army abroad, and the prisoners of war
confined in this country."<a name="FNanchor_722" id="FNanchor_722"></a><a href="#Footnote_722" class="fnanchor">[722]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">The City and
the first Corn
Law, March,
1815.</div>

<p>No sooner had the price of wheat fallen than a
Corn Law Bill was introduced into Parliament, in
the interests of the landed gentry, to raise it again.
The Bill was brought in on the 1st March (1815), and
rapidly passed the Commons, in spite of protests from
the Common Council, as well as the livery of London,
who objected to the landowner, who had benefited
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</a></span>by the war, being made richer at the expense of the
tradesman and merchant, whose burdens the war had so
much increased.<a name="FNanchor_723" id="FNanchor_723"></a><a href="#Footnote_723" class="fnanchor">[723]</a> On the 21st the Bill passed the Lords,
and only awaited the Regent's assent to become law.
Determined to make one more effort the Common
Council presented an address to his royal highness
begging him to withhold his assent.<a name="FNanchor_724" id="FNanchor_724"></a><a href="#Footnote_724" class="fnanchor">[724]</a> They complained
of the "precipitancy" with which the Bill had been
passed, and of the utter disregard of public feeling and
opinion which both Houses&mdash;composed as they were
of landed proprietors, to whom the war had been a
source of emolument&mdash;had throughout displayed. The
Bill had been passed (they repeated) in the interest of
landowners, who already enjoyed sufficient immunities,
whereas the manufacturer and the merchant, who had
done so much to make England what she was, had to
suffer from foreign competition and the recent introduction
of machinery. The Bill, if passed, would keep
up the price of food, and so drive the manufacturer and
artisan to foreign parts, and transfer the skill, industry
and capital of the kingdom to other nations. They
prayed his highness, therefore, to exercise his prerogative
of refusing his assent to the Bill. This he
refused, however, to do, and the Bill became law.
As to the merits or demerits of free-trade, opinions
are still divided; but for thirty years after the
passing of the first Corn Law the City never lost an
opportunity of declaring its opposition to the principle
involved,<a name="FNanchor_725" id="FNanchor_725"></a><a href="#Footnote_725" class="fnanchor">[725]</a> and never rested until in 1846 the first
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</a></span>steps were taken for the abolition of all corn duties.
However much others have benefited by their repeal,
one cannot shut one's eyes to the fact that to the
agricultural class the result has been little short of
disastrous.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A year of

<p>Unfortunately the depression was not confined

(8 Feb.): "Your petitioners are deeply sensible"&mdash;they
told the House of Commons&mdash;"of the depressed

<div class="sidenote">Address of
the livery to
Regent,
21 Aug., 1816.</div>

<p>As time went on matters became worse, and in
August the livery resolved to present another address
to the Regent, calling his attention to the prevalent
distress, which they characterised as "unparalleled in
the history of our country," and which they declared
to be "the natural result of a corrupt system of
administration," as well as of the profligate waste of
public money during the late war. An address was
accordingly drawn up (21 Aug.) praying his highness
to lose no time in recommending to the serious
consideration of Parliament (1) the distressed state
of the country; (2) the prompt abolition of all useless
places and pensions; (3) the immediate and effectual
reduction of the standing army; (4) a system of the
most rigid economy in every public department, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</a></span>
last, but not least, (5) such a reform of Parliament as
should restore and secure to the people their ancient
constitutional rights. This address they ordered to
be presented to the Prince Regent "seated on his
throne." The address was never presented, for the
reason that the Regent refused to receive it in any
other way than at a lev&eacute;e or through the medium of
his secretary of state. The livery therefore had once
more to console themselves with passing a number of
resolutions after the usual manner.<a name="FNanchor_727" id="FNanchor_727"></a><a href="#Footnote_727" class="fnanchor">[727]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">The city
flooded with
vagrants.</div>

<p>The streets of the city, meanwhile, swarmed
not only with artisans out of work, but, what was
worse, with discharged soldiers and sailors. A large
proportion of the last mentioned class were foreign
seamen. At the close of the war the government
had taken steps to send to their respective countries
all foreign seamen who had served on British vessels.
Many of them, however, had either declined the
government offer, or, having accepted it and obtained
a passage home, had come to England with the view
of entering the English merchant service or obtaining
some other employment in this country. It was in
vain that the lord mayor (Matthew Wood)<a name="FNanchor_728" id="FNanchor_728"></a><a href="#Footnote_728" class="fnanchor">[728]</a> applied
to the foreign consuls to send them home. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[Pg 298]</a></span>answer was that they had "forfeited all claim on
their native country and violated the allegiance
they owed to it by entering the service of Great
Britain." The consequence was that great numbers
of these unfortunate men wandered about the city in
an utterly destitute condition. Oftentimes when
opportunity offered for sending some of them to their
own country their consuls could not find them. The
lord mayor, who was in communication both with
Lord Sidmouth and Lord Melville, suggested the
advisability of mooring an old vessel in the Thames
for the reception of foreign seamen until they could be
sent home. Lord Melville, as first lord of the admiralty,
signified his approval of the plan and promised to
supply a suitable vessel. In the meanwhile, matters
daily grew worse. The lord mayor complained to Lord
Sidmouth (16 Nov.) that he had frequently been
engaged from nine in the morning until six in the
evening attending to destitute cases:&mdash;"I have had
before me two hundred in a day, of whom the greater
number have come from Wapping and the out
parishes, and not one in twenty has slept in
London." If only the magistrates (he declared)
would examine into the cases of their own districts,
"it would divide the labour and prevent the daily
assemblage of from one to two hundred of these poor
creatures around the Mansion House, some of whom
linger about it all night." In conclusion he begged to
draw his lordship's attention once more to the
situation of the foreign seamen who were found on
the bridges and in the streets "literally starving,"
and to ask that the government should do something
to relieve the City of the heavy expense which their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[Pg 299]</a></span>
presence entailed. The only reply which the secretary
of state vouchsafed to this appeal was a <i>non possumus</i>.
The government had done all they could do, and
relief could only be looked for at the hands of the
foreign consuls, whose duty it was to provide for
their own poor.<a name="FNanchor_729" id="FNanchor_729"></a><a href="#Footnote_729" class="fnanchor">[729]</a></p>

on every side, the livery of London again met in
Common Hall on the 29th November. They felt
that it was useless to attempt to get an address
received by the Regent in the manner they deemed
proper; so they again passed resolutions urging all
counties, corporate bodies, towns, wards and parishes
throughout the kingdom to lay their grievances
at the foot of the throne and before Parliament in
a firm, temperate, and peaceable manner, with the

<div class="sidenote">Lord Mayor's
report of Spa
Fields Riot,
3 Dec., 1816.</div>

<p>In the meanwhile a series of riots had taken
place in various parts of the country. In agricultural
districts ricks had been fired, and in manufacturing
towns machinery had been wantonly destroyed. In
December, a riot known as the "Spa Fields Riot"
broke out, but was repressed without much difficulty,
thanks to the courage of the lord mayor. The first
intimation that Matthew Wood received that anything
was wrong, was about mid-day on Monday, the
2nd December. He was then told that a mob some
thousands strong was approaching the city by way of
Aldersgate Street; that a man had already been shot
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[Pg 300]</a></span>in a gun-maker's shop in Skinner Street, and that the
shop had been cleared of a large quantity of arms.
What subsequently took place is best told in Matthew
Wood's own report<a name="FNanchor_731" id="FNanchor_731"></a><a href="#Footnote_731" class="fnanchor">[731]</a> to his brother aldermen:&mdash;"I
immediately signified my intention of going out
to meet them and instantly Sir James Shaw and
Mr. White offered their services. On enquiring for
Police Officers, only two were to be found. We
hurried to Guildhall, where we met with only three
more, and attended by these five we advanced
by the back streets in the hope of reaching the top
of Cheapside before the Mob; in Lad Lane we
were told that they had already entered Cheapside
in great force with Colors, and the firing was
distinctly heard by us, we returned therefore immediately
with all imaginable speed by the way of
Princes Street into Cornhill, with the view of
heading them in that direction; in this however we
were again foiled, for in reaching the West end of
Cornhill, we saw them pressing [<i>sic</i>] the front of
the Exchange. We followed them close, and seeing
the head of their Column crossing into Sweeting's
Alley we rushed thro' the Royal Exchange in order
to take them in front and we succeeded. We met
them on the North of the Royal Exchange near the
Old Stock Exchange, on seeing me they cheered,
we immediately attacked them, upon which they
began to seperate in all directions and some laid
down their arms. Sir James Shaw intrepidly seized
the Flag and its Bearer, Mr. White seized one man
and I another. The Mob were now seen flying in
all directions: about this time Mr. Favell and Mr.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[Pg 301]</a></span>Hick joined us, a man with a tricolored Cockade in
his hat (Hooper) came up to me with a desire to
explain. I made him go before me into the Exchange
which he did without resistance. I had him
in the centre when two fellows levelled their Musketts
at me. I said, 'fire away, you Rascals.' One of
them fired. I then gave Hooper into the Custody
of the Officers, who found in his pockets two
Horse Pistols, one loaded with Ball, the other with
Slugs. A cry that the mob had rallied was heard
just as we were making arrangements for securing
the Prisoners. I ordered the gates of the Exchange
to be shut, which we accomplished with some
difficulty and not before several guns loaded with
shot were fired under the gates at our feet, but
without any effect. Information being now received
that a portion of the Rioters had gone towards the
East end of the City, it was determined to follow
them, directions having been first given to put the
prisoners into the custody of the Master of Lloyd's,
with whom Sir James Shaw also lodged the Standard.
I proceeded accompanied by Sir James and
a few Constables up Cornhill and Leadenhall Street,
but here we were told, the Mob had wholly dispersed;
which induced us to return to the Mansion
House, where I found Sir William Curtis, who in his
zeal for the Public Service, had lost sight of all
personal ailments, and had come, ill as he was, to
offer me his best services, by this time also the
Dragoons had reached the City. Mr. Alderman
Atkins who had been sitting in the Justice Room
for me also joined us, and it being suggested, that it
would be proper that the different Wards should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[Pg 302]</a></span>
collect as many of their respectable Inhabitants
as possible, to be sworn in Special Constables, I
immediately gave directions to that effect. Sir
James Shaw and Mr. Alderman Atkins tendered
their Services to convey my wishes to Lloyd's and
the Stock Exchange and these Gentlemen informed
me that the proposition was received and accepted
at each of these places by the Gentlemen with
cheers. These Gentlemen next proceeded to the
Bank where they saw the Governor, and had the
satisfaction to learn he had anticipated their wishes;
a division of the Bank Corps being then actually
under arms. From the Bank they proceeded to the
India House and met with several of the Directors
in attendance who immediately gave orders for 500
of their men to be selected as a Guard on their
warehouses, who were soon after sworn in Constables
by Mr. Alderman Atkins. When these
Gentlemen returned to the Mansion House there
were assembled Sir John Eamer, Sir John Perring,
Sir William Leighton, Sir Charles Flower, Alderman
J.J. Smith, Alderman Scholey, Alderman Birch,
Alderman Magnay, Alderman Heygate, Alderman
Cox and Sheriffs Bridges and Kirby with their
Under-Sheriffs. About 3 o'clock information was
brought me, that the Mob had broken into the
Warehouses of Messrs. Branden and C<sup>o</sup>. and Mr.
Rea's and had taken from each a quantity of arms,
and almost at the same moment I received intelligence
that the plunderers had been met and
dispersed by the Dragoons, who had made some
Prisoners, and recovered most of the arms. During
the absence of Sir James Shaw and Mr. Alderman<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[Pg 303]</a></span>
Atkins Mr. White of Bishopsgate Street had arrived
with a Troop of Light Dragoons which he had
fetched from the Light Horse Stables, Grays Inn
Lane, and Mr. Goldham having been dispatched
with a few of them to reconnoitre, now returned
with a Coach loaded with Musketts, Swords,
Blunderbusses, Pikes, Halbuts, and a brass Cannon
which had been taken from the Mob in the Minories
by the Life Guardsmen and three Prisoners were
sent into Aldgate Watchouse and committed to the
care of a Constable, who by a shameful dereliction
of his duty suffered them to escape. Mr. M<sup>c</sup> Lean
of Brunswick Square, who had not long left the
Mansion House, returned about four o'Clock and
informed me, that, the Meeting in the Fields had
broken up, and that, there were 15,000 people
coming down Holborn and passing to Fleet Market.
I determined to go and meet them; Sir James Shaw
and Mr. M<sup>c</sup> Lean tendered their Services, when
taking some Police Officers some Special Constables
and a Detachment of Dragoons with us we moved
on in a quick pace by the North side of St. Paul's
Church Yard where we met about 2,000 persons,
but seeing they were without arms of any kind and
perfectly peaceable, we allowed them to pass on.
We proceeded Westward and nearly to the middle
of Fleet Street when meeting another party of
Dragoons, who informed us everything was quiet
in that Quarter we returned to the Mansion House,
I having first directed a party of the Horse accompanied
with Police Officers to make the Circuit of
the Prisons and to report to me when they had so
done. The City was quiet from this time. About<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[Pg 304]</a></span>
12 o'Clock at Night some papers taken by the
Constable out of the Pocket of the Man who shot
Mr. Platt were shown to me, by which I learned
that Hooper was connected with Preston the Secretary
of the Spa Fields Meeting. These papers state
that subscriptions towards defraying the expences
of erecting Hustings, Printing &amp;c., will be received
by J. Hooper No. 9 Graystock Place Fetter Lane
signed Preston Secretary. About one in morning
accompanied by Mr. Sheriff Kirby, Mr. Under-Sheriff
Kearsey and others with some Constables, I
went to No. 9 Graystock Place and made the
Householder come down, who proved to be Preston
the Secretary. We searched the House and found in
it very few papers&mdash;one an Hymn, and another a
letter of exhortation on the subject of 'England
expects every Man to do his duty.' There was
likewise a small quantity of Tricolored Ribbon.
Preston had two daughters and there were only
two Beds on the floor in the same room, the whole
house in a most wretched condition&mdash;with scarsely
a chair; in the room used by Hooper for the
reception of subscriptions there was no other furniture
but a table. Preston said Hooper did not
lodge there nor did he know where he lived. It is
supposed Watson Jun<sup>r</sup>. was the Person who fired
the Pistol at Mr. Platt, as Hooper says he did not
see Watson for some time after they left the Fields,
and it appears that he went into the Shop alone.
The Officer was induced to let him escape through
the entreaties of Mr. Beckwith's family who were
apprehensive should he be detained that the house
would be pulled down. I have no doubt had the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[Pg 305]</a></span>
Mob not been prevented it was their intention to
have collected a great number of fire arms and then
to have returned to Spa Fields and from thence to
Carlton House. Hooper admits that they intended
to go to Carlton House, but not with fire arms.
Hooper said that Watson Jun<sup>r</sup>. gave him the Pistols
on Sunday night at Preston's House and in his
presence said that if they were opposed by the Civil
power, they were to use them."</p>

<p>The lord mayor closed his narrative with a
handsome acknowledgment of the services rendered
by his brother aldermen, the special constables and
others, whilst he expressed a desire more particularly
to call the attention of the Court to the conduct
of Sir James Shaw, "whose zeal, activity, coolness
and undaunted courage," had rendered him such
valuable assistance throughout the day.</p>

his opinion, shared as he said, by a large portion of

of "unavoidable causes." He was confident that the
good sense, public spirit, and loyalty of the nation
would prove superior to the attempts that had been
made to "irritate and mislead" his subjects. And

went further than this. It passed a resolution expressing
its own "surprise and regret," that his

answer at such a time; that he should have imputed
to those who sought only a reformation of abuses,
a desire to "irritate and mislead" the people, and

<p>Parliament had not sat many days before the

petitions to both Houses for Reform. The

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[Pg 307]</a></span>of the most glaring anomalies&mdash;that Cornwall alone
returned more borough members than fifteen other
counties together including Middlesex, and more than
eleven counties even including county members,<a name="FNanchor_735" id="FNanchor_735"></a><a href="#Footnote_735" class="fnanchor">[735]</a> whilst
the livery referred all the evils which the country was
suffering&mdash;"the prodigious amount of the National
Debt, the enormous and unconstitutional military
establishments, the profusion of sinecure places and
pensions, and a long course of lavish expenditure of
the public money"&mdash;to one source, viz., "the corrupt,
dependent, and inadequate representation of the
people in Parliament." They disclaimed all wild
and visionary plans of Reform. All they desired was
"to see the House of Commons in conformity with
pure constitutional principles, a fair and honest organ
of the public voice exercising a controuling power
over the servants of the Crown, and not an instrument
in their hands to oppress the people."<a name="FNanchor_736" id="FNanchor_736"></a><a href="#Footnote_736" class="fnanchor">[736]</a></p>

three several charges for which he was put on trial three
several days. The charges were professedly for having
published pamphlets of a blasphemous character, but
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[Pg 308]</a></span>the persistency with which they were pressed after

not hesitate to tell Parliament as much.<a name="FNanchor_738" id="FNanchor_738"></a><a href="#Footnote_738" class="fnanchor">[738]</a> They
declared that they had viewed with indignation and
horror the vindictive cruelty with which ministers
had exercised their power since the suspension of the
Act. Numerous individuals (they said) had been
torn from their wives and families, dragged to distant
prisons and kept in irons, and afterwards released
without being brought to trial, or even knowing the
nature of the charges against them. The country
had been flooded with spies and informers in the pay
of the government, and these inhuman wretches had
endeavoured to excite simple and deluded men into
acts of outrage and treason. The petitioners did not
disguise their belief that "the groundless alarms
excited by ministers were solely for the purpose

As is usually the case at such times,
demagogues were at hand urging the sufferers to revolutionary

a number of others being wounded. The affair,
which was caused by magisterial blundering, came to
be known as the "Manchester massacre" or "Peterloo,"
and proved a formidable weapon against the government.
Hunt was taken, but liberated on bail, and on

<p>The Common Council expressed much sympathy

assemble for the purpose of lawfully and peacefully
discussing public grievances, and they petitioned the
Regent for a full and immediate enquiry into the outrage
and for the punishment of the authors. They

<div class="sidenote">Proceedings
in Common
Hall, 29 Sept.,
1819.</div>

<p>The city itself presented signs of uneasiness. On
Michaelmas-day, when the election of a lord mayor
took place, a great commotion had been raised in
Common Hall by sheriff Parkins, alderman Waithman,
"Orator" Hunt and others, who wished to
introduce violent resolutions against the government.
The sheriff made himself especially obnoxious to the
outgoing lord mayor (Atkins), chiefly, it appears, on
account of the Court of Aldermen having refused to
recognise him (Parkins) as the senior sheriff. His
conduct in Common Hall, as well as the conduct of
Waithman and certain others, was deemed so bad by
the Court of Aldermen that legal proceedings were
ordered to be taken against them.<a name="FNanchor_747" id="FNanchor_747"></a><a href="#Footnote_747" class="fnanchor">[747]</a> The Common
Council expressed disapproval at any proceedings being
taken, and recommended their withdrawal. The
Court at the same time directed the City Chamberlain
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[Pg 312]</a></span>not to pay any costs of the proceedings.<a name="FNanchor_748" id="FNanchor_748"></a><a href="#Footnote_748" class="fnanchor">[748]</a> The Court
of Aldermen were not unnaturally indignant at this,<a name="FNanchor_749" id="FNanchor_749"></a><a href="#Footnote_749" class="fnanchor">[749]</a>
but declined to withdraw from their position, and
eventually a judgment was obtained in the King's
Bench, which completely justified the position they
had taken up. It was laid down by the judges that
when a Common Hall has been summoned for a particular
purpose, the livery have no right to introduce
matter for consideration distinct from that for which
they were assembled. The defendants in this case,
however, were exonerated on the ground that they
had been misled by an opinion given by Glynn, the
City's Recorder in 1773, as to their rights.<a name="FNanchor_750" id="FNanchor_750"></a><a href="#Footnote_750" class="fnanchor">[750]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Conduct of
Sheriff
Parkins.</div>

<p>In the meantime, sheriff Parkins had continued
to make himself as obnoxious as he could. He refused
to attend at church on Michaelmas-day, and on
the following day, when he should have accompanied
his fellow sheriff, to be presented at Westminster to
the Barons of the Exchequer, he wrote a rude letter
to the mayor, excusing himself joining the procession
on the score that he was busily engaged in his duties
at the Old Bailey, and could not be "at two places
one and the same time." Later in the day, he
presented himself at Westminster, but without any
state, and declined to invite the Barons of the Exchequer
to the entertainment usually provided by
the sheriffs on such occasions. He, in fact, gave no
entertainment at all. He ought to have accompanied
the mayor to the Court of Aldermen on the 8th
October, but he again excused himself, on the plea of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[Pg 313]</a></span>a headache, which he had the coolness to attribute to
"the incessant noise and dreadful screams" at the last
Common Hall. The mayor complained to the Court
of Aldermen, and the sheriff was called upon to
explain his conduct at the next Court.<a name="FNanchor_751" id="FNanchor_751"></a><a href="#Footnote_751" class="fnanchor">[751]</a> When the
Court met, Parkins read a long statement, which for
sheer impudence will bear comparison with some
productions of Wilkes or Junius, whilst lacking their
cleverness. The reason he gave for not having
accompanied the lord mayor to Westminster was
that he did "not choose to divide with the lord
mayor those marks of popular feeling which everywhere
follow the track of the city state carriage
during the present mayoralty." The lord mayor
and the other sheriff had made the best part of the
journey to Westminster by water, as was then the
custom, but Parkins had reverted to the more ancient
custom of riding thither on horseback.<a name="FNanchor_752" id="FNanchor_752"></a><a href="#Footnote_752" class="fnanchor">[752]</a> It was true (he
said) that he was not accompanied by any member of
his company, but that was because "it would have been
neither decorous nor prudent to have set on foot or
even on horseback any rival procession, since it might
have been deemed by the lord mayor a demonstration
of hostility against his own supremacy," and so
on and so on. His whole defence was after the
same manner, but all that the Court of Aldermen did
was to refer his conduct to a Committee of Privileges
(12 Oct.), and there the matter appears to have
ended.<a name="FNanchor_753" id="FNanchor_753"></a><a href="#Footnote_753" class="fnanchor">[753]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Accession of
George IV,
29 Jan., 1820.</div>

<p>On the evening of Saturday, the 29th January,
(1820) George III passed away, and on Sunday morning
his death was notified to the lord mayor. A
special Court of Aldermen was immediately summoned
to sit at the Mansion House, when the mayor laid
before them two letters from Lord Sidmouth, one
informing him of the king's decease, and the other
desiring his attendance at Carlton House, at one o'clock
that afternoon. He also laid before the Court another
letter which he had subsequently received. This was
a letter from the Clerk of the Privy Council, stating
that the lords of the Council would meet at one o'clock,
at Carlton House, and that the lord mayor and Court
of Aldermen might attend, if they thought proper.
Thereupon the lord mayor, the aldermen, and the high
officers of the city proceeded in state (the black
sword being borne before the mayor) to Carlton
House, where they heard and subscribed the proclamation
of King George IV. On their return to the
Mansion House, the York herald delivered a copy of
the ceremonial to be observed the next day, when the
king should be proclaimed. Upon the arrival of the
procession the following day at Temple Bar, the lord
mayor took up his position in his state coach immediately
before the archbishop of Canterbury; the
aldermen, sheriffs, chamberlain, common serjeant,
town clerk and city officers immediately after the
lords of the Privy Council. The proclamation was
publicly read at Carlton House and Charing Cross and
at three different places within the City's jurisdiction,
viz.: at the corner of Chancery Lane, the corner of
Wood Street, Cheapside, and at the Royal Exchange.<a name="FNanchor_754" id="FNanchor_754"></a><a href="#Footnote_754" class="fnanchor">[754]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">City addresses
to George IV,
28 Feb., 1820.</div>

<p>When sheriff Parkins and his brother sheriff,
Rothwell, attended at Carlton Palace to learn when it
would be convenient for the king to receive addresses
from the City, they found his majesty much indisposed.
Monday, the 28th February, was fixed for receiving
the addresses of the Courts of Aldermen and Common
Council, but an intimation was given to the sheriffs
(privately, it appears) that the state of the king's health
would require the addresses to be presented in a room
adjoining his majesty's bedroom by a small deputation
from each Court. When Rothwell, the senior
sheriff, communicated the result of their mission to the
aldermen and the Common Council, Parkins again
made himself obnoxious, declaring that <i>he</i> had heard
nothing about the addresses being presented by small
deputations, and that as a matter of fact "his majesty
did not appear to him to be so unwell as he had been
led to expect from the various reports he had heard."
No notice was taken of this exhibition of bad taste,
and both Courts agreed to present their addresses by
deputation. To each of them the king made gracious
replies, promising that the welfare and prosperity of
the City and the maintenance of its rights and liberties
should be objects of his constant care.<a name="FNanchor_755" id="FNanchor_755"></a><a href="#Footnote_755" class="fnanchor">[755]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">City addresses
to Queen
Caroline,
June, 1820.</div>

<p>The ceremony was somewhat marred by an
injudicious attempt of the unhappy queen to force her
way into the abbey. Whatever may have been the
extent of her folly or her guilt no one can question
the misfortune of Queen Caroline. From the first
moment of their meeting she was treated by her
husband with scant courtesy and was soon forced to
quit his side and lead a life of retirement at Blackheath.
A watch was set on her movements and her
conduct made the subject of a private enquiry by the
lords. The City was no less indignant than the princess
herself at such a proceeding. The livery presented
her with an address of sympathy,<a name="FNanchor_759" id="FNanchor_759"></a><a href="#Footnote_759" class="fnanchor">[759]</a> and at the close of
the enquiry the Common Council congratulated her
upon having escaped from a "foul and atrocious
conspiracy against her life and honour."<a name="FNanchor_760" id="FNanchor_760"></a><a href="#Footnote_760" class="fnanchor">[760]</a> The Court
of Aldermen, however, once more held aloof. This
was in 1813. In the following year she withdrew
disgusted to the continent and there remained until
her husband succeeded to the throne. Again the livery
and the Common Council presented addresses and
testified their attachment to one whom most people
looked upon as an injured woman, who had in vain
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[Pg 317]</a></span>challenged her accusers to appear before a public and
impartial tribunal.<a name="FNanchor_761" id="FNanchor_761"></a><a href="#Footnote_761" class="fnanchor">[761]</a> Her wish was now to be gratified.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The queen's

<p>Another secret enquiry into her conduct was held
by the lords, at the king's command, and upon evidence
thus scraped together and unsupported by oath a Bill
of Pains and Penalties was introduced into the House
of Lords for depriving the queen of her title and
dissolving her marriage. The Common Council entered
a strong protest and appealed to both Houses to reject
the Bill,<a name="FNanchor_762" id="FNanchor_762"></a><a href="#Footnote_762" class="fnanchor">[762]</a> but in vain. The queen was put on her
defence, and after a protracted trial succeeded with the
help of her learned counsel&mdash;Brougham, Denman and
Lushington&mdash;in placing her conduct in such a light
that the Bill had to be abandoned.</p>

<div class="sidenote">City address

<p>The news of the queen's triumph was received

She declared that it was to the sympathy
and support of the people and of the Press that she
was chiefly indebted for her escape from a conspiracy
such as had never before threatened an individual, and
although she doubted whether her presence in the
country was conducive to the national welfare, as
seemed to be generally supposed, she expressed herself

<div class="sidenote">The queen at

<p>The Court of Aldermen, as a body, had rigidly

Nevertheless, there were two members of the Court
who thoroughly believed in her innocence, and who
rendered her every assistance in their power. These
were Matthew Wood, in whose house in South
Audley Street she first found shelter on her return
from abroad, and Robert Waithman. Matthew
Wood continued to attend her at Brandenburgh
House, where she kept her court, and where he
dined with her the day that the Bill against her

to write to the Corporation, whilst her trial

to "the first city in the world" for the zeal they
had manifested in her cause, and it was Waithman
who laid the letter before the Common Council. The

<div class="sidenote">The queen at

<p>An intimation which the Common Council received
from the gentleman acting as the queen's
vice-chamberlain that she proposed to attend the
usual service held at St. Paul's on Wednesday, the
29th November, was received with mixed feelings. It
was feared that her appearance in the city might
cause inconvenience, and perhaps lead to riot. Nevertheless
a special committee was appointed to give her
a suitable reception.<a name="FNanchor_769" id="FNanchor_769"></a><a href="#Footnote_769" class="fnanchor">[769]</a> A similar foreboding was felt
by the Court of Aldermen as soon as they heard of
the queen's intention, and a motion was made expressing
regret; but before any vote could be taken
on the matter, the Court was abruptly broken up by
Wood and Waithman leaving.<a name="FNanchor_770" id="FNanchor_770"></a><a href="#Footnote_770" class="fnanchor">[770]</a> On the 27th, the
Court again met, when communications were read
from the Dean of St. Paul's, and from Lord Sidmouth,
touching the preparations to be made for her majesty's
reception in the Cathedral, and the precautions to be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[Pg 320]</a></span>taken against injury being done by accident or otherwise
within the sacred precinct or in the public
streets. The lord mayor was promised the assistance
of the military if necessary. Again, a motion was
made expressive of regret at the queen's proposal,
but with no better success than at the previous Court.
Alderman Wood again got up and left the Court so
as to reduce the number present to less than a

a count out.<a name="FNanchor_771" id="FNanchor_771"></a><a href="#Footnote_771" class="fnanchor">[771]</a> Fortunately the day passed off without
any mishap. One of the chief grievances which the
queen had been made to suffer had been the omission
of her name from the Liturgy. On this occasion she
desired that "the particular thanksgiving, which at
the request of any parishioner, it is customary to
offer up" might be offered on her behalf, but the
officiating minister refused on the ground that the
rubric directed that "those may be named, who have
been previously prayed for, but that the queen not
having been prayed for, could not be named in the
thanksgiving." After all was over, the queen communicated
her thanks to the lord mayor and the
committee for the trouble they had taken, and
expressed herself as particularly obliged to his lordship
for not yielding to alarm, and for declining all
military assistance.<a name="FNanchor_772" id="FNanchor_772"></a><a href="#Footnote_772" class="fnanchor">[772]</a></p>

<p>The circumstances attending her funeral were of
a most disgraceful character. She had expressed a
wish to be buried in her own country, and this wish
was carried out. The citizens were extremely anxious
to pay a last token of respect in the event of her
corpse being brought through the city to Harwich, the
port of embarkation, and the Remembrancer waited
upon Lord Liverpool for the purpose of notifying to
him the resolutions passed by the Common Council to
that effect. As in Chatham's case, so in the case of
this unfortunate queen, the wishes of the citizens were
ignored. After some delay they were informed that
the funeral arrangements were already completed, and
had been laid before the king, and that it was not
intended that the procession should pass through the
city.<a name="FNanchor_779" id="FNanchor_779"></a><a href="#Footnote_779" class="fnanchor">[779]</a> The people, nevertheless, decided otherwise,
and succeeded in gaining the day. This was not
accomplished, however, without bloodshed. In order
to insure the funeral procession passing through the
city, the roads not leading in that direction were
blocked and the pavement taken up. At Knightsbridge
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[Pg 323]</a></span>the mob came into collision with the military
quartered in the barracks there. Stones and mud
were freely thrown, and the guards were tempted at
last to fire on the mob, killing two of their number.
After the procession had passed through the city, with
the lord mayor at its head, it was allowed to continue
its course without further opposition. This took place
on Tuesday, the 14th August.<a name="FNanchor_780" id="FNanchor_780"></a><a href="#Footnote_780" class="fnanchor">[780]</a></p>

<p>On the 26th, when the funeral procession of the

occurred. Waithman, who was sheriff at the time,
fearing lest the sight of soldiers outside the barracks
might infuriate the people, had taken the precaution
of asking the officers in command to keep their men
within the gates until the procession had gone by,
but the only answer he got was that "the sheriff
might be d&mdash;d, they would not make their men
prisoners for him." In the course of the day
Waithman himself was struck. This led to a long
correspondence with Lord Bathurst, one of the
principal secretaries of state, but the sheriff failed to
get any redress. The Common Council instituted
an enquiry, and upheld his action.<a name="FNanchor_781" id="FNanchor_781"></a><a href="#Footnote_781" class="fnanchor">[781]</a> The Court of
Aldermen ignored the whole affair, but one of their
number, viz., Sir William Curtis, a member for the

dictating to the rest of the world. In their eyes
"national independence is to states what liberty is to
individuals," and that being so the Common Council
readily voted two sums of &pound;1,000 to assist Spain and
Greece in throwing off their respective yokes.<a name="FNanchor_783" id="FNanchor_783"></a><a href="#Footnote_783" class="fnanchor">[783]</a> In
1823 the relations between the City and Spain, then
threatened by France, were of such a friendly nature
that a proposal was actually made to set up, in the
centre of Moorfields, a statue of Don Rafael Del Riego,
a patriotic Spanish general, who had lost his life in the
cause.<a name="FNanchor_784" id="FNanchor_784"></a><a href="#Footnote_784" class="fnanchor">[784]</a> In the following year (1824) the City again
raised its voice against the pretensions of the Holy
Alliance, and opposed the renewal of the Alien Act,
mainly on the ground that its renewal would appear
to countenance the action of the allies "against the
independence of nations and the rights and liberties
of mankind."<a name="FNanchor_785" id="FNanchor_785"></a><a href="#Footnote_785" class="fnanchor">[785]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Revival of
trade followed
by wild
speculation,
1825-1826.</div>

<p>A revival of commerce, which commenced in 1821,
was succeeded in 1825 by an era of wild speculation
such as had not been seen since the days of the South
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[Pg 325]</a></span>Sea Bubble. The civic authorities protested against
the reckless formation of Joint Stock Companies, but
in vain.<a name="FNanchor_786" id="FNanchor_786"></a><a href="#Footnote_786" class="fnanchor">[786]</a> Before the end of the year a crash came,
firms and companies began to break, credit was shaken,
trade depressed, and a run on banks took place, resulting
in many of them stopping payment altogether.
In six weeks between sixty and seventy banks are said
to have stopped payment, of which six or seven were
London houses. The distress which ensued was widespread,
so widespread indeed that it extended to
Scotland, and brought to grief that "wizard of the
North," whose writings have delighted, and continue
to delight, so many thousands, both young and old&mdash;Sir
Walter Scott. In the city of London the
Spitalfield weavers were reduced to such straits that
the Corporation had to come to their assistance with
a grant of &pound;500.<a name="FNanchor_787" id="FNanchor_787"></a><a href="#Footnote_787" class="fnanchor">[787]</a> Although the worst was over by
the end of 1825, bankruptcies were frequent during
the following year, whilst the country was much
disturbed by riots and attacks on all kinds of machinery,
which the artisan foolishly regarded as the chief cause
of all the misery. When Venables, the lord mayor,
went out of office (Nov., 1826) and the Common
Council passed the usual vote of thanks, they expressly
referred to the decision, energy and judgment he had
evinced "during a recent period of commercial embarrassment,"
and the prompt measures he had taken
for relieving distress and restoring confidence.<a name="FNanchor_788" id="FNanchor_788"></a><a href="#Footnote_788" class="fnanchor">[788]</a></p>

The Common Council resented what they considered to be an unjust

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XLIV" id="CHAPTER_XLIV">CHAPTER XLIV.</a></h2>


<div class="sidenote">Repeal of
Corporation
and Test Acts,
May, 1828.</div>

<p>In November (1826) a new Parliament met. Of
the old city members only one&mdash;viz., Matthew Wood,
the popular alderman&mdash;retained his seat. He was
joined by two other aldermen, one of them being the
no less popular Waithman, and a commoner. The
questions most pressing were Catholic Emancipation
and Parliamentary Reform. The latter had been long
urged by the City. As regards the emancipation of
Catholics, the City had at one time shown considerable
opposition. In 1790, the Common Council expressed
itself as anxious to strengthen the hands of those friends
of the established church who had twice successfully
opposed in Parliament the repeal of the Corporation
and Test Acts&mdash;a necessary preliminary to Catholic
emancipation&mdash;and had called upon the city members
and those of the Common Council who had seats in
Parliament, to resist any future attempt that might be
made in the same direction.<a name="FNanchor_789" id="FNanchor_789"></a><a href="#Footnote_789" class="fnanchor">[789]</a> Since that time the citizens
had changed their minds, and we find them now (May,
1827), passing resolutions against the iniquity of making
the solemn ordinance of the Lord's Supper "a qualification
and passport for power," and congratulating the
king upon his having placed Canning, a notorious
friend of Catholic emancipation, in power.<a name="FNanchor_790" id="FNanchor_790"></a><a href="#Footnote_790" class="fnanchor">[790]</a></p>

<p>Canning unfortunately died before he was able to
accomplish anything in this direction, and his successor,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[Pg 327]</a></span>Goderich was deficient in moral backbone; but early
in 1828 the Duke of Wellington became Prime Minister,
and upon a motion made by Lord John Russell, a Bill
was introduced for the repeal of the Corporation and
Test Acts. A simple declaration that an applicant
for office would not compromise the Established
Church, was to be substituted for the old sacramental
test. During the passage of the Bill through the
Lords, the City endeavoured to get certain amendments
introduced, for the purpose chiefly of protecting

<p>Renewed activity on the part of the Catholic

The question was taken up by Peel, hitherto an anti-Catholic.
He succeeded in winning over the Duke

king to promise some concession at the opening of

<p>The other pressing question of the day, viz.,
Parliamentary Reform, awaited settlement under a
new king and a new Parliament. On the 26th June,
1830, George IV died, and his eldest surviving brother,
the Duke of Clarence, was welcomed by the City as
his successor under the title of William IV. The
City&mdash;both Aldermen and Common Council&mdash;lost no
time in presenting the usual congratulatory addresses,<a name="FNanchor_795" id="FNanchor_795"></a><a href="#Footnote_795" class="fnanchor">[795]</a>
but not a word was said on the subject that was about
to move the country from one end to the other. A
month later (28th July) the livery prepared a long
address, in which, disclaiming "the fulsome strains of
unmeaning flattery," such as they declared had been
poured into the royal ear "from more than one body
of men in the city of London already," they respectfully
but firmly laid before the new king a representation
of what they believed to be the true state
of affairs. The chief grievance of the country, they
said, lay in the fact that the great body of the people
who paid taxes, had no control whatever over those
who falsely called themselves the representatives of
the people; and they expressed their long-confirmed
and deep-rooted conviction that this and all other
evils had arisen from the people not being properly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[Pg 329]</a></span>represented in the House of Commons. Notwithstanding
former rebuffs they desired that their address
should be received by the king on his throne. As this
could not be&mdash;although the king expressed his willingness
to receive it at the next lev&eacute;e, or through the secretary
of state&mdash;the address was not presented at all.<a name="FNanchor_796" id="FNanchor_796"></a><a href="#Footnote_796" class="fnanchor">[796]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">A General
Election,
July, 1830.</div>

<p>The accession of a new king necessitated the
dissolution of Parliament and fresh elections. These
took place amid great excitement, for already the
country was agitating by means of political unions for
Parliamentary reform. At their close it was found
that the Government, although losing many seats,
still retained a majority. No change was made in
the city members.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Opening of
the new
parliament,
2 Nov., 1830.</div>

<p>When parliament met on the 2nd November,
the country was on the tip-toe of expectation as to
what the ministry would do. Would the Duke of
Wellington continue to ignore the manifest will of the
nation or would he give way? He did the first. He
not only declared that the country was satisfied with
the existing state of things, but he pledged himself to
oppose any measure of Parliamentary reform that
might be proposed by others. Here was a distinct
challenge to the reformers, a challenge which they
were not slow to take up. That same night Brougham,
who had been returned to Parliament for Yorkshire,
free of expense, gave notice that on the 16th, he
would bring forward a motion for reform. Before
that day arrived the ministry had resigned.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The king's

<p>In the meanwhile, the new king had received a

day most convenient, and his majesty had graciously
accepted the invitation, and had named the 9th
November, lord mayor's day.<a name="FNanchor_797" id="FNanchor_797"></a><a href="#Footnote_797" class="fnanchor">[797]</a> He chose that day
for the reason probably that it was customary for
a new sovereign to honour the citizens with his
presence on the first lord mayor's day after his
accession. Extensive preparations had already been
made to give the king a befitting reception, when on
the 7th November, Sir Robert Peel informed the outgoing
mayor by letter, that his majesty had been
advised to forego his visit to the city, for fear lest his
presence might give occasion to riot and tumult, and
endanger the property and lives of his subjects. The
fact was, that the lord mayor elect (Sir John Key)
had, on his own responsibility, written to the Duke of
Wellington warning him of danger. A copy of his
letter was read before the Common Council on the
8th, when exception was taken to it as being "indiscreet
and unauthorised." After considerable debate, a
resolution was at length drawn up to the effect that
in the opinion of the court "neither riot nor commotion
was to be apprehended had his majesty and his
royal consort ... condescended to honour the
city of London with their presence; and that had
evil disposed and disaffected persons made attempts
to excite commotion or disturbance on that occasion,
the most perfect reliance might have been placed
on the good feeling and spontaneous exertions of the
great mass of the population of London to co-operate
with the civil power in effectually suppressing
such attempts and preserving the public tranquility."<a name="FNanchor_798" id="FNanchor_798"></a><a href="#Footnote_798" class="fnanchor">[798]</a>
This was all very well. Nevertheless, in spite of all
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[Pg 331]</a></span>precautions taken by the civic authorities, and although
the king and his ministers, who had given so much
offence by opposing the popular will, refrained from
entering the city, an affray actually took place at

of the crown, that the representation is satisfactory

the public expenditure, and the organ by which the

in the legislature to which, by the constitution they
are entitled.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Resolved</span> that petitions founded upon these
resolutions, be forthwith presented to both Houses
of Parliament, praying them to institute a full and
faithful inquiry into the state of the representation
with the view to the remedying of such defects therein
as time and various encroachments have produced,
so as to give real effect to the essential principles of
the constitution, namely, that members of parliament
shall be freely chosen, that peers shall not
interfere in elections, and that in the House of

Bill introduced,
1 March, 1831.</div>

<p>The new prime minister was Lord Grey, who, as a
young man, had urged the necessity of parliamentary
reform as early as 1792. Among those who were
content to accept office under the new ministry,
although in an inferior capacity, was Lord John
Russell, who had also done good service for the
cause, and who was now to be entrusted with the
task of introducing the long looked for Bill. On
the 1st March (1831) the first Reform Bill, which for
the last sixty years the City had been anxiously<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[Pg 333]</a></span>
awaiting, and for which it had agitated with all the
forces at its command, was at length brought in.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Bill

<p>As soon as the provisions of the Bill became
known the Common Council, who had hitherto
refrained from expressing any opinion upon the
nature of the change that had taken place in the
ministry, hastened to express their satisfaction to the
king at the policy adopted by his new ministers;&mdash;"We
beg to assure your Majesty that having long
entertained a deep and increasing conviction of the
necessity of a reform in the representation of the
people in the Commons House of Parliament, we
have looked forward with the greatest anxiety to

adopt in reference to that important subject; and
we now feel ourselves imperatively called upon,

measure that has been introduced, under their
sanction, to the Honorable House of Commons."<a name="FNanchor_802" id="FNanchor_802"></a><a href="#Footnote_802" class="fnanchor">[802]</a>
The livery, too, presented an address in much the
same terms, although by the provisions of the Bill nonresident
liverymen were threatened with exclusion
from the franchise. The Bill, they said, afforded
a clear proof of the sincerity and honesty of his
majesty's ministers, and entitled them to the best
thanks and lasting gratitude of the country. They
further presented addresses in the same strain to both
Houses of Parliament.<a name="FNanchor_803" id="FNanchor_803"></a><a href="#Footnote_803" class="fnanchor">[803]</a> The Court of Aldermen, on

<div class="sidenote">Dissolution of

<p>The debate on the first reading lasted seven

by a majority of eight, and thereupon the government
withdrew the Bill, and Parliament was dissolved
in order that the question might be submitted to the
country (22 April). A special Court of Common
Council was summoned to meet on the 27th, when
the committee which had been recently appointed
to watch the proceedings in Parliament relative to
the Bill, reported the fact of the dissolution, and
recommended the City to place on record its "cordial
gratitude" to the king for having thus given the
country an opportunity of expressing its wishes. A
resolution was thereupon passed to that effect. This
was followed by another resolution expressing a
fervent hope that at the general election about to
take place all minor considerations might give way
to the one great duty of promoting the country's
welfare, and that only such members would be
returned as would unequivocally pledge themselves
to support his majesty's ministers in carrying the
great question of reform to a successful issue. By so
doing they would overthrow "a faction arrayed in
hostility against the liberties of their country, and

least after the closing of the poll. These steps were
taken pursuant to Stat. 8 George II, c. 30, but the

city the three aldermen, viz., Wood, Waithman and
Thompson, who sat in the last Parliament, were
again returned, but William Ward, who had been

<p>The opponents of the measure believed and hoped

up an address to the king expressive of the City's bitter
disappointment at the Lords "having turned a deaf
ear to the nation's voice, and thrown out the great
Bill for consolidating the peace, prosperity and
liberties of the people," and of its continued confidence
in his majesty's ministers. The address
concluded with a solemn warning that unless the

<div class="sidenote">Agitation in

<p>The City's prognostications of evil arising out of
the Lords' refusal to bow to the will of the nation
were fully justified. The streets of London and other
large towns became the scenes of disorderly riots.
At Derby the houses of those opposed to reform
were attacked by the mob and their windows
smashed. The ancient castle of Nottingham, once
a royal residence, was fired and reduced to a pile
of smoking ruins. At Birmingham a meeting was
held at which those who were present pledged
themselves to pay no taxes if the Reform Bill were
again rejected,<a name="FNanchor_812" id="FNanchor_812"></a><a href="#Footnote_812" class="fnanchor">[812]</a> whilst at Bristol, nearly a whole
square was burnt by the mob.<a name="FNanchor_813" id="FNanchor_813"></a><a href="#Footnote_813" class="fnanchor">[813]</a> The political unions
that had sprung up all over the country resolved
to increase their strength by the formation of a
National Political Union, which should have its head-quarters
in London. To this end, a meeting was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[Pg 338]</a></span>held in Lincoln's Inn Fields, on the 31st of October,
with Sir Francis Burdett in the chair. The proceedings,
however, took such a radical turn that before
long Burdett withdrew his name from the association.
The government, too, became alarmed at the prospect
of a meeting announced to be held on the
7th November. Orders were given to swear in
special constables, the whole of the recently established
(1829) police force was to be held in readiness,
and a large body of troops was quartered in the
neighbourhood of the capital ready to put down any
disturbance that might arise. On the 4th November&mdash;three
days before the proposed meeting&mdash;a royal
proclamation was read before the Court of Aldermen
calling upon all his majesty's liege subjects to assist
the civil magistrates in putting down disturbances as
soon as any should appear, and to aid in the
preservation of the peace. Thereupon a resolution
was passed to the effect that each member of the
Court in his respective ward should immediately
enroll and swear in a number of special constables
to assist the magistracy upon any tumult, riot,
outrage or breach of the peace occurring within
the city.<a name="FNanchor_814" id="FNanchor_814"></a><a href="#Footnote_814" class="fnanchor">[814]</a> Thanks to the precautions thus taken,

14 May, 1832.</div>

<p>For a whole week the country was kept in a
state of suspense, anxiously waiting to see whether the
Duke of Wellington, who had declared his willingness
to accept office and to give his support to a less complete
measure of reform, would succeed in forming an
administration or not. Whilst negotiations were
being carried on the Common Council met (14 May),
and drew up a long and strongly-worded address
ending with a declaration that they&mdash;the lord mayor,
aldermen and Common Council of the city of London&mdash;would
be wanting in their duty to themselves and to
posterity, if they did not express their overwhelming
sorrow at the resignation of his majesty's late honest
ministers, and their serious apprehension that unless
Lord Grey and his colleagues were promptly recalled
and allowed to pass the Reform Bill unmutilated
and unimpaired, the country would witness those
"calamities which have affected other nations when
struggling to be free."<a name="FNanchor_827" id="FNanchor_827"></a><a href="#Footnote_827" class="fnanchor">[827]</a> There would, in fact, be a
revolution, such as had been witnessed in France at
the close of the last century.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Re-call of
Earl Grey's
ministry,
18 May, 1832.</div>

<p>When the sheriffs applied for an appointment
to be made for the reception of the address, they
were put off from time to time. Thereupon, the
matter was taken up by the recently appointed joint
committee, and on the 18th, they had an interview
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[Pg 343]</a></span>with Earl Grey, but by that time matters had been
accommodated, and there was no longer any occasion
for presenting the address. The Duke of Wellington
had three days before (15 May), communicated to
the king his inability to form a ministry, and on the
evening of the 18th, formal announcement was made
to both houses that Earl Grey and his colleagues had
been recalled and were in a position to carry
through the Bill unimpaired in efficiency and without
mutilation.<a name="FNanchor_828" id="FNanchor_828"></a><a href="#Footnote_828" class="fnanchor">[828]</a> The Common Council took an early
opportunity of expressing their utmost satisfaction at
the turn of affairs, and passed resolutions to that
effect, which were ordered to be delivered to the
secretary of state, and also to be published in all the
morning and evening newspapers.<a name="FNanchor_829" id="FNanchor_829"></a><a href="#Footnote_829" class="fnanchor">[829]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">The Reform
Bill becomes
law, 7 June,
1832.</div>

<p>The question naturally arose whence this confidence
of the recalled ministry? Was the House of
Lords to be swamped by the creation of a batch of
new peers, or had an arrangement been made for
securing the withdrawal of the requisite number of
opposition peers? The answer was soon forthcoming.
When the Bill again came before the lords, the Duke
of Wellington left the house, and was followed by
about a hundred other peers. The bishops withdrew
in a body, and the Bill, with some trifling alterations,
which the Commons readily accepted, was passed by
a large majority (4 June), and three days later
received the royal assent.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The rights of
the livery
saved.</div>

<p>The Bill as introduced in December last, had to
undergo some alterations in order that the proposed
plan of reform might embrace the livery franchise
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[Pg 344]</a></span>peculiar to the city of London. The necessity of
amendments in this direction did not escape the attention
of the committee appointed on the 21st April
(1831), to watch the course of the Reform Bill and
to give support to Earl Grey's ministry; and the day
after the Bill had received the royal assent, this
committee had the satisfaction of reporting to the
Common Council that the most important of the
amendments proposed by them had been adopted
and introduced in the Act.<a name="FNanchor_830" id="FNanchor_830"></a><a href="#Footnote_830" class="fnanchor">[830]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Celebration of
Reform at
Guildhall,
11 July, 1832.</div>

<p>The citizens were immensely pleased at the
success which, after so long a struggle, had at last
attended their efforts to secure a better representation
of the people in the House of Commons. The measure
was not and could not be final, but it was a step, and a
long step in the right direction, and as such, the Common
Council resolved that it should be publicly celebrated,
and honour given to those to whom honour
was due in effecting its accomplishment. An Irish
and a Scottish Reform Bill were still before parliament,
but as the passing of these measures was looked upon
as a foregone conclusion, they were not allowed to
stand in the way of the City's proposed celebration of
the passing of the English Bill. Earl Grey and Lord
Althorp had not yet received the Freedom of the City
voted in April last. It was therefore arranged that
the Freedom should be conferred upon these ministers
with all the pomp and ceremony that befitted the
occasion on Wednesday, the 11th July,<a name="FNanchor_831" id="FNanchor_831"></a><a href="#Footnote_831" class="fnanchor">[831]</a> and that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[Pg 345]</a></span>the presentation should be followed by an entertainment
at the Guildhall, given to all those members of
the House of Commons who had voted for the third
reading of the Bill, as well as to those peers who had
voted against Lord Lyndhurst's amendment, and such
other noblemen and gentlemen as had lent their aid to
the cause. In acknowledging the honour conferred
upon him Earl Grey paid befitting tribute to the City's
influence in the commercial world, its loyalty to the
constitution, and its love of freedom "never more
conspicuously manifested" than during recent events.<a name="FNanchor_832" id="FNanchor_832"></a><a href="#Footnote_832" class="fnanchor">[832]</a>
A book containing the autographs of the principal
guests, among whom was the Duke of Sussex, is preserved
in the Guildhall library, as well as a medal
struck in commemoration of the passing of the Bill.<a name="FNanchor_833" id="FNanchor_833"></a><a href="#Footnote_833" class="fnanchor">[833]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">A retrospect.</div>

<p>With this signal triumph of the people, to which the
city of London had contributed so much, the present
work is brought to a close. No good end would be
served by entering the domain of contemporary politics.
Enough has been set out in these pages to convince
the impartial reader that the city of London is no mean
city; that it possesses a record equal, if not indeed
superior, to that of any other city in the Universe,
ancient or modern, and that its wealth and influence
have ever been devoted to the cause of religious, social
and political freedom. Notwithstanding anything its
detractors may say, the City has not only marched
with the age, it has for the most part been a leader of
public opinion, and has shown itself in advance of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[Pg 346]</a></span>age. It is to three notable aldermen of the city, viz.,
Oliver, Crosby, and Wilkes, be it remembered, that the
country is indebted for the liberty of the press, and the
freedom of reporting Parliamentary debates, so long
jealously withheld. Had it not been for the determined
attitude of these aldermen the country might
have waited still longer for Parliament to be brought to
realise that its proceedings are (so to speak) public
property. It was Wilkes, again, and his brother aldermen
who made a successful stand against the pernicious,
if lawful, custom of pressing men for the king's service,
the result being that whilst the rest of the kingdom
was over-run with press-gangs, the city of London was
quit of them, or if any ventured to seize the person of
a citizen, they were soon made to surrender their prey.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Enfranchisement
of Jews.</div>

<p>If other evidence, beyond what appears in these
pages, were wanting in proof of the enlightened policy
pursued by the Corporation of London, it will be found
in the fact that Jews were enfranchised and admitted
into the city's council and to all municipal offices long
before they gained admission into the council of the
nation. In December, 1830, the Common Council
passed a Bill for extending the Freedom of the City to
all natural born subjects, not professing the Christian
religion but in other respects qualified, upon their
taking the Freeman's oath according to the forms of
their own religion.<a name="FNanchor_834" id="FNanchor_834"></a><a href="#Footnote_834" class="fnanchor">[834]</a> Five years later David Salomons,
a Jew, was admitted to the shrievalty. In 1847 he
was elected alderman, and in 1855 became lord mayor.
In the meanwhile, repeated attempts had been made
to get Parliament to pass a Bill for altering the oaths
of allegiance and supremacy, in such a manner that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[Pg 347]</a></span>
Jews might be relieved of the necessity of making a
declaration "upon the true faith of a Christian." The
House of Commons had again and again passed Bills
to this effect, but they had always been rejected by
the Lords, who steadily refused to give their assent to
the admission of Jews, notwithstanding the entreaties
of the city of London.<a name="FNanchor_835" id="FNanchor_835"></a><a href="#Footnote_835" class="fnanchor">[835]</a> The election of Alderman
Salomons to the mayoralty was regarded by the livery
of London as "a triumph to liberal principles," and as
affording a prospect "of the ultimate triumph of the
cause of toleration by the admission of the members
of the Jewish persuasion to the legislature, and the
highest offices of the State."<a name="FNanchor_836" id="FNanchor_836"></a><a href="#Footnote_836" class="fnanchor">[836]</a> Their hopes were
now destined to be soon realised. A compromise was
at last effected, and three years later (23 July, 1858),
a Bill was passed allowing either House by a resolution
to modify the form of oath required from its members.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Baron Rothschild,
M.P.,
for the City.</div>

<p>For years the City had been content to suffer
for its principles. Ever since 1847 it had continued
to return a Jew to Parliament, in the person of
Baron Lionel Rothschild, in spite of the fact that he
was not allowed to take his seat. As soon however as
the Bill became law, the House of Commons passed the
necessary resolution, and on the 26th April the Baron
took his seat, and the City recovered its full representation
in Parliament. Both Alderman Salomons and
Baron Rothschild commemorated their respective
victories by endowing scholarships in the City of
London School, open to candidates of every religious
persuasion; and a like scholarship was founded by a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[Pg 348]</a></span>committee known as the "Committee of the Jewish
Commemoration Fund."<a name="FNanchor_837" id="FNanchor_837"></a><a href="#Footnote_837" class="fnanchor">[837]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">The City's
finances.</div>

<p>The city of London was, as we have seen,
known in earliest times as the king's "Chamber," and
the Chamberlain was the king's officer. The City in
fact served as the purse of the nation, until such time
as the establishment of the Bank of England did
away with the necessity of direct applications to the
Corporation for loans, to enable the government of
the kingdom to be carried on. Like the nation itself,
the City has had its times of pecuniary distress, and
nothing but the most careful nursing of its estate has
enabled it to tide over its difficulties. More especially
was this the case at the close of the civil war, and
again, for some years after the Great Fire, as well as
at the commencement of the reign of Queen Anne.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The City's
public spirit.</div>

<p>The City has not wasted its substance. Large
sums have been expended upon local improvements,
upon the erection of markets, upon bridges, not forgetting
that latest marvel of engineering skill, the
Tower Bridge, upon the City's schools, upon the
erection of the Guildhall library with its adjacent
Museum and Art Gallery, as well as upon the establishment
and maintenance of one of the most successful
Schools of Music ever known in this country. At
the close of the year 1882, the Corporation had,
within a comparatively recent period, expended
nearly six and a half millions, out of its own funds,
upon improvements within the city and liberties&mdash;improvements
which benefited the inhabitants of
the metropolis generally no less than the citizens<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[Pg 349]</a></span>
themselves.<a name="FNanchor_838" id="FNanchor_838"></a><a href="#Footnote_838" class="fnanchor">[838]</a> Nor has the Corporation stayed its hand
at the city's boundaries. During the short period of
ten years preceding 1882, a sum of more than &pound;300,000
was expended out of the city's cash for providing open
spaces for the people, including Epping Forest, Wanstead
Park, West Ham Park, and Burnham Beeches,
but irrespective of the later acquisitions of Coulsdon
and other adjacent commons in the county of Surrey,
since dedicated to the public.<a name="FNanchor_839" id="FNanchor_839"></a><a href="#Footnote_839" class="fnanchor">[839]</a> An area exceeding
6,000 acres in all, has thus been preserved for posterity
and placed beyond risk of purprestures and
encroachments.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The City and
the Metropolitan
Board
of Works.</div>

<p>From the time when the Metropolitan Board of
Works was first established in 1855, down to its disestablishment
in 1889, the Corporation contributed
large sums of money to assist that body in carrying
out the stupendous work of the Thames Embankment,
a work of which Londoners may well be proud, and
were engaged jointly with the Board in freeing from
toll the bridges of Staines, Walton, Hampton Court,
Kingston and Kew, on the Thames, as well as
Tottenham Mills and Chingford bridges on the Lea.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Abolition of
coal and
wine dues,
1889.</div>

<p>Since the abolition of the coal and wine dues in
1889, the whole of which had been devoted to carrying
out improvements, erecting public buildings, and freeing
bridges, in and near the metropolis,<a name="FNanchor_840" id="FNanchor_840"></a><a href="#Footnote_840" class="fnanchor">[840]</a> the work of the
Corporation, as well as of the London County Council
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[Pg 350]</a></span>(the successor to the Metropolitan Board of Works), in
this direction has been sorely crippled. It was popularly
supposed that the coal dues affected the price of coal
and gas, and that as soon as the dues were abolished
the price of these commodities would at once go
down. The result has proved to be far otherwise. An
income of more than half a million sterling, produced
in such a way as to afford the minimum of burden
to the taxpayer, and expended in such a way as to
produce the maximum of benefit to the whole of the
metropolis, has been lost to the City and the London
County Council, whilst the consumer not only pays
the same price as before for his coal and gas (the
middle-man pocketing the tax), but finds himself
saddled with an increased rate.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The City as
Port sanitary
authority.</div>

<p>One more remark and we have done. As conservators
of the river Thames, the Corporation did
much to improve its navigation, but in 1857 the conservancy
was taken away from the City and became
vested in a board. In 1872, however, the Corporation
became the sanitary authority of the Port of London
under somewhat remarkable circumstances. When
the Public Health Bill of that year was framed, the
Local Government Board long hesitated as to whom
the duty of acting as the sanitary authority of the
Port of London should be committed. At the last
moment the Corporation stept in and volunteered
to undertake the duty free of expense. The government
readily accepted the offer, and to this patriotic
act on the part of the municipality as well as to the
energy of its executive officers, it is largely due that
this vast metropolis enjoys comparative immunity from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[Pg 351]</a></span>
cholera and zymotic diseases and that the city itself,
besides being the best paved and the best lighted, is
also the most healthy city in the civilised world.</p>

</p>

<p>Be it remembered that on the 1<sup>st</sup> day of October it was
noised abroad throughout the city that Edward the Fourth King
of England had fled, for which cause the Queen Elizabeth who
had fortified the Tower of London quitted the same Tower and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">[Pg 386]</a></span>
fled to the sanctuary at Westminster and sent the Abbot of
Westminster to Richard Lee the Mayor and the Aldermen to
inform them on the Queen's behalf that the men of Kent and
many others from divers parts of England in great numbers were
purposing to enter the city and lay siege to the said Tower and the
men at arms whom the said Queen had left behind in the same
Tower; that the same Queen desired that the said Tower should
be delivered into the hands of the Mayor and Aldermen because
the said Queen was afraid, it was said, that unless the said Tower
was so surrendered the said Kentishmen and others would invade
the said sanctuary of Westminster to despoil and kill the said Queen.
And be it remembered that the said Tower was on the Wednesday
next following delivered into the hands of the Mayor and Aldermen
and of Geoffrey Gate, knight &amp; others of the council of the
lords Clarence and Warwick on condition that all who were then
within the said Tower should remain safe &amp; secure with their
goods and be conducted in the city of London either to the
Sanctuary at Westminster or Saint Martin according as they might
wish. And be it remembered that the lord Henry the Sixth who
on the said Wednesday and for many years past had been confined
in a certain cell (<i>in quodam Argastulo</i>) within the said Tower, was
conducted by the said mayor and Aldermen to a certain chamber
adorned with handsome furniture which the said Queen Elizabeth
had fitted up and in which, being <i>enceinte</i>, she purposed being
brought to bed. And be it remembered that the aforesaid Mayor
and Aldermen for the safe custody of the said Tower and the said
lord the King Henry the Sixth then living in the same placed in
the said Tower the persons underwritten, namely</p>

<p class="center">                    [Here follows a list of names.]
</p>

<p>And each of the said Commoners had with him in the same Tower
2 men at arms to wait upon him.</p>

<p>And be it remembered that all the foregoing was executed by
authority of the common council assembled in the church of Saint
Stephen in Walbrok.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">[Pg 387]</a></span></p>

<p>Also be it remembered that on the 5<sup>th</sup> day of October the Archbishop
of York entered the Tower of London with a large band of
men at arms and took command of the said Tower and relieved
the said Aldermen and Commoners of the custody of the same
And be it remembered that on Saturday the 6<sup>th</sup> day of October
George Duke of Clarence and Richard Earl of Warwick entered
the City by Newgate about the third hour after noon with a large
army and rode through <i>le Chepe</i> to the said Tower of London and
took away the lord the King Henry the Sixth and brought him
the same day before nightfall to the Bishop of London's palace.</p>

<p>Be it remembered that as soon as it was notified that Edward the
Fourth had fled the Mayor and Sheriffs every day to wit for 10
days rode about the City with armed men both before nine and
after nine; the following men being sent by the masters and
wardens of the misteries to the Guildhall every morning to attend
upon the said Mayor and Sheriffs.</p>

<p>Be it remembered that the Mayor and Aldermen with the
assent of the Common Council fortified the banks of the river
Thames from Castle Baynard as far as the Tower of London with
men at arms, bombards, and other implements of war to prevent
an attack by the seamen who had brought a large fleet of ships
near the Tower, and the said bank was held by the Aldermen and
the rest of the citizens in great numbers. Be it remembered also
that on Sunday viz: the 12<sup>th</sup> day of May in the eleventh year of
Edward IV, [1471] Kentish seamen and others, rebels of the lord
the king made an attack upon London bridge and on the new gate
there and set fire to divers houses called <i>berehouses</i> near the hospital
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">[Pg 392]</a></span>of Saint Katherine; and afterwards on the 14<sup>th</sup> day of May being
Tuesday the eleventh year aforesaid about eleven o'clock in the
morning of the said Tuesday the said Kentish seamen and other
rebels made an attack with great force and set fire to 13 tenements
upon London bridge. The said Kentish seamen and others to the
number of 5000 persons also made an attack from the Thames upon
the gates of Aldgate and Bishopsgate and set fire to divers tenements.
The citizens, however, sallied out of the gates and made a
stout resistance and put them to flight, and nearly 300 men fell in
battle and in flight besides those who were drowned in endeavouring
to get on board their ships at Blakewall &amp;c. And afterwards viz.:
on the eve of the Ascension the aforesaid eleventh year our said
lord King came with a great multitude of armed men to the city of
London and there to the honour of the same city created knights
John Stokton the Mayor, Richard Lee, Matthew Philip, Ralph
Verney, John Yong, William Tailor, aldermen, Thomas Urswyk
the Recorder, George Irlond, William Hampton, Bartholomew
James, Thomas Stalbrok and William Stokker, aldermen. And
the same lord the King conferred upon them knights' badges.</p>

</p>

<p>The Queenes maiestie was sundry wise aboute the latter ende
of this sommer infourmed of some secrete whisperinges in certaine
places of Yorkshire, and the Bishopricke of Durham that there was
lyke to be shortly some assemblies of Lewde people in those partes
tendinge to a rebellyon: Whereof, because at the first the informac&otilde;ns
conteyned no evident or direct cause or proofe therfore
her Maiestie had the lesse regarde therto, untill upon certayne
convenc&otilde;ns and secrete meetinges of the Earles of Northumberlande
and Westmerlande, w<sup>th</sup> certen personnes of suspected
behavor, the formor reportes were renewed and thereof also the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_412" id="Page_412">[Pg 412]</a></span>
saide two Earles were in vulgare speaches from place to place
expresslye noted to be the auctors, whereupon the Earle of Sussex,
lorde President of her Ma<sup>ties</sup> councell in those north partes, gave
advertisment of the like brutes, addinge nevertheles (to his
knowelege) there was no other matter in dede but lewde rumors,
sodaynly raised and sodaynly ended. And yet shortely after he
sent for the two Earles w<sup>th</sup> whom he conferred of those rumors:
who as thei could not deny but that thei had harde of suche, yet
(as it nowe afterward apperethe) falsely then dissemblinge, thei
protested themselves to be free from all suche occasions, offeringe
to spende theire lyves against any that shulde breake the peace
and so muche trusted by the said lorde president upon theire
othes, they were licensed not only to departe, but had powre geven
to examyn the causes of the said brutes. Neverthelesse the fire
of theire treasons w<sup>ch</sup> thei had covered was so greate, as it did
newly burst out mo flames. Whearupon her Maiestie beinge
alwais lothe to enter in any open misport of any of her nobilitie,
and therfore in this case desirous rather to have bothe the saide
Earles cleared from suche sclaunders and her good people that
lived in feare of spoile to be quitted comaunded the lord President
(as it semed) havinge than discovered somewhat further of theire
evill purposes, dyd onely at the first write to them to come to hym
to consult upon matters apperteynynge to that councell, whereunto
they made delatory and frivolous answeres: and so beinge once
agayne more earnestly required, thei more flatly denyed. And
last of all her Maiestie sent her owne private letters of comaundement
to them to repaire to her presence all w<sup>ch</sup> notw<sup>th</sup>standinge,
thei refused to come: And havinge before the delivery of her
Ma<sup>ties</sup> letters to them assembled as great numbers as they could
(w<sup>ch</sup> were not many, for that the honester sorte dyd refuse them)
thei did enter into an open and actuall rebellion armynge and
fortifyinge them selfes rebelliously in all warlike maner and have
invaded houses and churches and published proclamac&otilde;ns in there
owne names to move her Ma<sup>ties</sup> subiectes to take theire partes, as
personnes that meane of theire private auctorite to breake and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_413" id="Page_413">[Pg 413]</a></span>
subvert Lawes threateninge the people that if thei cannot atchive
theire purposes, then strangers will enter the Realme to fynyshe
the same. And w<sup>th</sup> this they adde, that they meane no hurte to
her Ma<sup>ties</sup> personne a pretence always first published by all traitors.
And as for reformac&otilde;n of any greate matter, it is evident thei be
as evill chosen two personnes (if there qualities be well considered)
to have creditt, as can be in the whole Realme. And nowe her
Maiestie manifestly percyvinge in what sorte these two Earles
beinge both in povertie, the one havinge but a very small porc&otilde;n
of that wiche his auncesters had and lost, and the other havinge
almost his whole patrimony wasted, do go aboute throughe the
perswasion of a nomber of desperat persons associated as parasites
w<sup>th</sup> them to satisfie there privat lacke and ambicioun w<sup>ch</sup> cannot be
by them compassed w<sup>th</sup>out coveringe at the first certeine highe
treason against the quenes Ma<sup>ties</sup> person and the Realme, longe
hidden by suche as have heretofore provoked them, w<sup>th</sup> the cover
of some other pretended generall enterprises hathe thought good
that all her good lovinge subiectes shulde spedely understand
howe in this sorte the said two Earles contrary to the naturall
propertie of nobilitie (w<sup>ch</sup> is instituted to defende the prince
beinge the head and to preserve peace) have thus openly and
traitorrously entred into the first rebellyon and breach of the
publique blessed peace of this Realme that hath heppened
(beyonde all former examples) duringe her Ma<sup>ties</sup> raigne w<sup>ch</sup> nowe
haithe contynued above eleven yeares, an acte horrible against
god the only gever of so longe a peace; and ungratefull to there
soveraigne Lady to whom thei two particularly have heretofore
made sundry professions of there faith and lastely most unnaturall
and pernicious to theire natyve cuntrey that hath so longe enyoied
peace, and nowe by there only mallyce and ambicioun is to be
trobled in that felicitie. And herew<sup>th</sup> also her Maiestie chargeth
all her goode subiectes to employ there hole powers to the

<p>Now for asmutche as godes blessinges wonder fullie abounde

Whereas the contempners thereof &amp; the immoderate affectors of
the Romish religion &amp; suspersticions, beinge voide of the true
knowledge of god, have declyned from god, their allegiance to
their prince their love to their countrey, And have become inventors

<p>We have behelde thes thinges &amp; seene in our daies the ruyne

<p>Letter from the Lords of the Council to Sir Arthur Chichester,
Deputy in Ireland, as to the course to be pursued with the
City's Commissioners, appointed to view the Irish Estate.
Dated Whitehall, 3 Aug., 1609.</p></div>

<p class="center">  Transcripts, &amp;c., Irish Government (Public Record Office), Vol. I,

</p>

<p>After o<sup>r</sup> very harty comendac&otilde;ns to yo<sup>r</sup> Lp. we have written
unto yo<sup>ur</sup> Lp. and the Counsell there a letter wherein we have in
generall recommended certaine cittizens appointed by the Citty of
London to view the Derrye and Colrane and the cuntrie between
them; And in this have thought it expedient to declare o<sup>r</sup> minde
somewhat more particulerly, because we shoulde be sorry that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_426" id="Page_426">[Pg 426]</a></span>any endeavo<sup>r</sup> or informac&otilde;n should be lacking that might either
satisfie or encourage them For when we consider how slowly this
busines hath yet gon forward since it was first intended, how fit
&amp; able the Citty is for a work of y<sup>t</sup> importaunce, of what good use
their example wilbe to draw on others and lastly what reputac&otilde;n
it will give both abroad and at home to y<sup>e</sup> action y<sup>t</sup> is like really
to be effected we are moved to recommend them the more earnestly
unto yo<sup>r</sup> Lp. to take order that all occasions of discouragement
may be prevented which som indiscreete persons may unprovidently
suggest, if choice be not made of such to conduct and
accompany them, who for their experience and understanding
shalbe able both by discourse and reason to controule whatsoever
any man shall reporte, either out of ignorance or mallice, and to
give the undertako<sup>rs</sup> satisfacc&otilde;n when they shalbe mistaken or not
well informed of any particuler. For which purpose the conductors
must have care to lead them by the best waies and to lodge them
in their travaile, where if it be possible, they may have English
entertainement in Englishmens howses. And howsoever we have
had the opportunitye heere to lay the first hand upon this offer,
and to make the project unto the Cittie thereby to drawe them on
to entertaine the same for an entraunce into the business yet that it
may be both begun and well followed we send the same here
inclosed and must leave it to your lordship to perfect. Wherein we
thinck it fit. That those y<sup>t</sup> be sent in their company be so well
prepared before hand to confirme and strengthen every part
thereof by demonstrac&otilde;n as they may plainely apprehend &amp;
conceive the comodities to be of good use and profit; on the
other side, that matters of distast as feare of the Irish, of the
souldiers, cess and such like be not so much as named, seeing you
knowe that discipline and order will easilie secure them. And
if there be any thing conteyned in the Project, whether it be the
Fishing, the Admiralty or any other particuler w<sup>ch</sup> may serve for a
motyve to enduce them; Although yo<sup>r</sup> lordship or any other have
interest therein yet you shall make no doubt but his Ma<sup>ty</sup> will
have such considerac&otilde;n thereof that no man shalbe a looser in y<sup>t</sup>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_427" id="Page_427">[Pg 427]</a></span>w<sup>ch</sup> he shall parte w<sup>th</sup> for the furtheraunce of this service. And

<p>The greate necessetie of supplyinge the Kinges Army and

Commons is inforced to thinke upon a more present way of
raysinge moneyes then can bee effected in the Course of
Subsidies. Whereupon they have directed mee to pray your
Lorpp. to call a Co&#771;mon Hall with as much speede as conveniently
you may and to comend to the Cittizens of London the Loane of
&pound;60000 by such as shall freely and willingly contribute thereunto.
Which they intende not as any burthen unto them, but as
an occasion of further expressinge of theire good affecc&otilde;ns to the
publiq. Whereof they have soe often had experience and they
will soe provide that the Su&#771;me now desired to bee lent shalbe

My very good Lord and Gentlemen,<br />
</p>

<p>I have formerly by my lr&#275;s directed by order of the house
of Co&#771;mons vnto yo<sup>r</sup> Lo<sup>r</sup>pp signified their desire to borrow of the
City sixty thousand pounds for the presente supply of the Kings
Army and releif of the Northern partes conceived to tend principally
to the gen'all safety of the whole kingdome.</p>

<p>We could not but take notice of the forwardnes of the Citty
to comply and albeit there hath bin some protracc&otilde;n, yet we now
expect the expression of it in a speedie payment. I am therefore
required by the house of Commons to desire yo<sup>r</sup> Lo<sup>p</sup>p forthw<sup>th</sup> to
call a Comon Hall, and in that to signifie unto them our desires,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_429" id="Page_429">[Pg 429]</a></span>

<p>My lord and gentlemen I receaved so great expressions of

at my departure from you, that I cannot dispaire but to obtayne

stronger everywhere. Yet are wee in one great straight, and such
a one as if it bee not speedily remedyed, may quash all our hopes,
and endanger that peace, and libertie which wee so much strive for.
Our treasure w<sup>ch</sup> must maintayne y<sup>e</sup> army grows neere an ende,

<p>Wee heare (even now) since the writinge of this letter, that
(yesterday) divers of the Reformadoes came againe (in a threatninge
manner) to Westm<sup>r</sup> the house of Commons then sittinge to the
greate affrightment and terror of divers faithfull members then
present, and to discouragement of others from their attendance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_441" id="Page_441">[Pg 441]</a></span>
there, soe that we cannot but perceive, that the freedome of this
Parliament is noe better then that those members who shall
accordinge to their consciences endeavo<sup>r</sup> to prevent a second warre,
and acte contrarie to their wayes, who, (for their own preservac&otilde;n)
intend it they must do it with the hazard of their lives: which
indeed is a thinge soe destructive to Parliamen<sup>ts</sup> and freedome

to Uxbridg That soe we might contract our quarters w<sup>c</sup>h have
hitherto lyen scattered. At which place we hope to receive that
w<sup>c</sup>h wilbe satisfacc&otilde;n to the kingdome and will remove obstrucc&otilde;ns
out of the way of justice, wherein if right were done, wee should
let you and all the world see that we would be soe farr from
pressing neere yo<sup>r</sup> citie of London, it should be indifferent to us
to march not only to the distance already prescribed, but to any
part of the kingdome we should be commanded to by the Parliament.
Wee have asked nothinge hitherto but right in the things
that are knowne, as if they were proved an hundred times before
them from whome wee have sought them, w<sup>c</sup>h if graunted would
not only be a justice to the armie, but would lett the kingdome
see the ffountayne in a way to be cleered without w<sup>c</sup>h nothing of

name of priviledges may not be in the ballance w<sup>t</sup>h the safetie of a
kingdome, and the reality of doing justice, w<sup>c</sup>h as we have said
too often, we cannot expect whilest the persons we had accused
are the kingdomes and our judges. A little delay will indanger
the putting the kingdome into blood, notwithstanding what hath
bin said, if it be considered that in Wales (besides underhand
workings in yo<sup>r</sup> citie) and other places men are raised and that in
noe small nombres. And are not those men in the Parliam<sup>t</sup> who
have contynued faithfull to the principles of common interest
from the beginning of the Parliam<sup>t</sup> to this very day still awed by
the concourse of Reformadoe offic<sup>r</sup>s and others to their doores.
Expence of time will be their advantage only who intend to bring

perfect account of our intenc&otilde;ns and ends. And still to contynue

<p>To the end we may contynue a right understanding betweene
you and us all along in the manadgm<sup>t</sup> of this great busines, w<sup>t</sup>h
the Parliam<sup>t</sup> (the happie proceeding whereof so much concernes
the safety and peace of this Kingdome.) We have given yo<sup>r</sup> Commission<sup>r</sup>s

Commissioners of Parliam<sup>t</sup> residing w<sup>t</sup>h us. Wherein we take
notice of the true reasons of the slowe progresse in the Treaty, and
declare where the stoppe remains. And to the end that nothing
be wanting in us w<sup>c</sup>h might work towards the speedy settlem<sup>t</sup> of
the quiett of this Kingdome, wee have humbly offered what we
conceive will most effectually tend to remove those incombrances
and lettes, w<sup>c</sup>h stand betwixt us, and this universall good to the
Kingdome; and till that be done, it cannot be expected that we
should procure the peace of this nation by a Treatie, but rather
give occac&otilde;n and opportunity thereby to others to ingage us in a
second warr, w<sup>c</sup>h must necessarily hazard the ruine of this Kingdome,
as also ascertayne the destrucc&otilde;n of Ireland, the relief
whereof we should most effectually apply unto, were the affaires
of England, but once put into a hopefull way. It is a sound and
substantiall settlement of the whole we desire, in a generall safe
and well grounded peace, and the establish<sup>m</sup>t of such lawes, as
might duly and readily render to every man their iust rights and
liberties: And for obteyning of theis, not only our intenc&otilde;ns
have lead us, but we thinke that all the blood, treasure, and
labour spent in this warr was for the accomplishm<sup>t</sup> of theis very
things, w<sup>c</sup>h are of that concernem<sup>t</sup> both to our selfs and posterity,

<p>
My Lord &amp; Gentlemen,<br />
</p>

<p>By a copy of a vote of Common Councill held y<sup>e</sup> 4<sup>th</sup> of September
present (w<sup>ch</sup> was left at my house) I find my selfe declared
to bee an Ald&#771;ran of London, &amp; invited to y<sup>e</sup> execuc&otilde;n of that place.
The knowledge of my vnfitness for y<sup>t</sup> imploym<sup>t</sup> by reason of my
great age of 77 yeares, &amp; those infirmities y<sup>t</sup> accompany it, did
soon put me upon y<sup>e</sup> resoluc&otilde;n of getting my discharge from it.
But y<sup>e</sup> death of my eldest sonn's wife &amp; child, did overwhelme me
as well as him w<sup>th</sup> that greife, w<sup>ch</sup> permitted not my goeing abroad
untill the last Thursday, when I hoped to have found at Guildhall
a full court of Ald&#771;ren. But those expectac&otilde;ns failing me, I forbore
y<sup>e</sup> declaring my Intenc&otilde;ns &amp; desires then. And being this day
upon my retreat into the Country for the necessary refreshm<sup>t</sup> of
my selfe &amp; sonn I thought it my duty to acquaint yo<sup>r</sup> Lord<sup>p</sup>: &amp; this
Court w<sup>th</sup> my Condicon &amp; most earnest Request. I have now beene
laid aside about 12 yeares; The Rump Parliam<sup>t</sup> haveing first imprisoned
me in y<sup>e</sup> Tower (y<sup>e</sup> 24<sup>th</sup> of 7<sup>ber</sup> 1647), cheifly (as was
conceived) to prevent my being chosen Lord Mayor the Mich&atilde;s
following, where I remain'd vntill the 6th of the next June, when
I was enlarged w<sup>th</sup> out so much as Petic&otilde;ning. But afterwards to
satisfye y<sup>e</sup> Ambic&otilde;n of some that had a mind to bee in our seats,

of that Remain of a House of Commons that presumed to sitt as a
Parliam<sup>t</sup>, were disenabled &amp; discharged from being Ald&#771;ren, &amp;
others chosen in our steds. Notw<sup>th</sup>standing w<sup>ch</sup> displeasure of
those who usurped the Government &amp; my being out of their sight,
in y<sup>e</sup> Country, y<sup>e</sup> Citty retained those kind remembrances of me &amp;
my sufferings as to choose me 2<sup>ce</sup> one of their Burgesses, in those
Convenc&otilde;ns, w<sup>ch</sup> wee called then Parliam<sup>ts</sup> w<sup>ch</sup> as they are argum<sup>ts</sup>
that I enjoyed their favour, so they are Reasons that I take not ill w<sup>t</sup>
this Court, or y<sup>e</sup> Common Councill complyed in ag<sup>t</sup> my Right, out of
a feare of those who had made themselves Masters of the Three
Kingdomes as well as this Citty: And that sense of my duty w<sup>ch</sup>
made me accept of serving this Citty (where God hath blest me) when
called to it, &amp; continue in that service whilst permitted, would now
alsoe command my returne to the executing of my place, as an Ald&#771;ran,
upon that Invitac&otilde;n I have re&#772;cd, did not my finding and dayly
discovering my disabilityes perswade me that you in Justice ought
not to require, what I out of Conscience ought not to accept, ffor,
both my age hath a legall excuse from the troubles of Magistracy,
&amp; yo<sup>r</sup> affaires need that presentness of parts, w<sup>ch</sup> a life so much
worne out as mine is, cannot afford. I doubt not but I might have
obteyned my discharge elswhere, but because yo<sup>r</sup> Lord<sup>p</sup> &amp; this
Court, are those to whome y<sup>e</sup> memb<sup>rs</sup> of it especially are to betake
themselves I thought it unbecoming me so farr to despair of yo<sup>r</sup>
Justice &amp; ffavour, as to look for it in any other place. Wherefore,
I make it my importunate request to your Lord<sup>p</sup> &amp; this Hon<sup>ble</sup>
Court, that I may be discharged, for ever, from being an Ald&#771;ran,
&amp; part of that tyme that yet remaines of my life shall be spent in
pray<sup>rs</sup> for the happiness &amp; flourishing of this Renowned Citty And
when I shall have yo<sup>r</sup> dismission into y<sup>t</sup> privacy, wherein I may
vndisturbedly prepare for the other &amp; better world I am hasting

Highness the Duke of Cumberland upon this New motion of the
Rebels towards Derbyshire, had made the necessary Disposition
for getting before them, with the utmost Expedition; And
had determin'd for that purpose, to March, the direct way for
London. Part of the Cavalry of His Royal Highness's Army will be
this Night at Northampton, and the Remainder to Morrow, And the
Foot will Encamp to Morrow also near Northampton so that His
Royal Highness did not Doubt, but he should be able to reach
Northampton so as to be between the Rebels and London; But in
order that the Peace and Security of the City of London, may be
provided for, in all Events, His Majesty has commanded me to

be given for augmenting the Guard of the City, in such manner as
shall be thought proper; And that a sufficient Number of the
Train'd Bands may be constantly out in the day time, as well as at
Night, to preserve the peace of the City. Your Lordship will also

Notice of it.</p>

are at present, appointed for the several Guards to the City, and of

Sir,<br />
</p>

<p>The Westminster Committee observing that the London
Committee are instructed "to meet such Members of the Committees
of the several petitioning Counties, Cities and Boroughs
as are now in London, or who may be deputed for the purpose
of presenting, or supporting their Petitions, and who may think
it necessary to confer, on the means of promoting the common
object of the said Petition" have directed me to acquaint you
that it is their opinion, that nothing is so desireable in the present
Stage of the business as a general meeting of the several Committees
by their Agents or Deputies. From the correspondence
they have had with the other Committees they have reason to
think this opinion is pretty general; and therefore if the London
Committee should concur in that opinion they would wish to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_464" id="Page_464">[Pg 464]</a></span>
know in what manner the London Committee think such a
measure may be best effected.</p>

<p>It has been suggested that the London, Middlesex and
Westminster Committees, might meet by their Deputies and that a
joint invitation from them to the other Committees would come
with more propriety and weight than such a proposal from any
single Committee: But altho' this mode has been thought of,
any other that is equally adapted to bring about the measure
proposed, will be equally acceptable to the Westminster Committee.</p>

<p>
Sir,<br />
</p>

<p>I receive with great satisfaction and very humble acknowledgement,
the honour which the Committee of the Common Council
of London have been pleased to confer on me, by their Resolution
of the 3<sup>d</sup> Inst., which you have been so obliging as to transmit to
me. Their approbation of the plan which I submitted to Parliament;&mdash;the
effects which they expect from its being carried into
execution,&mdash;these secure to me the co-operation and support of
the greatest Corporation in the World, thro their very respectable
Committee. Be so good, Sir, as to assure that Committee, that I
shall be unwearied in my endeavours, to carry into execution the
measures which they have approved, and which, under such a
sanction, I am entitled to consider as leading to the attainment of
some part of the desires, which they, in common with multitudes
of our fellow subjects have lately express'd. I say some part,
because I am sensible that much more is wanting; and I protest
to the Committee, with great sincerity, that I shall be, as active, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_465" id="Page_465">[Pg 465]</a></span>
industrious, and as zealous in supporting the constitutional and
salutary measures, already proposed, and such as may be hereafter
proposed, by other Gentlemen, as I have been in endeavouring to
give effect to my own humble, but, certainly, well intended conceptions.
The people alone can procure the final attainment of
the just and temperate requests which they have made. Their
interference as constitutional always, as it was now necessary, has
already produced a visible effect. A continued watchfulness, on
their part, will beget an active attention in the Representative
body, to the Interests of their constituents. Let us continue true
to ourselves, and we shall not find many that will dare to be false
to us. Let each, in his station of public trust, give the best
Counsel his capacity suggests, and let our whole collective and
united efforts be applyd to execute whatever is wisely plann'd, be
the Proposer who he may. Let us do this and the People cannot
remain long unsatisfy'd in their just and reasonable desires.
I have the honour to be &amp;c.</p>

<p>Letter from Charles Fox to the Town Clerk of London forwarding
copy of proceedings of the Westminster Committee of
Association, and giving particulars of the proceedings of the
House of Commons upon Dunning's motion. Dated St.
James's Street, 13 April, 1780.</p></div>

<p>
Sir,<br />
</p>

<p>I have the honour of transmitting to you a copy of the
proceedings in Westminster Hall on the 6th inst. in which you
will observe that the form of Association adopted by the City of
Westminster, is nearly similar to that of the County of York.</p>

<p>There never was a time when Union was more necessary
than the present, as the only hopes of those who wish to defeat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_466" id="Page_466">[Pg 466]</a></span>
the wishes of the people, are confessedly founded upon supposed
disagreements among the true friends of their country.</p>

<p>I should long ago have transmitted to your Committee, lists
of the Members who have voted in the late important questions,
but have been unable to procure any on which I could depend.
That which was printed in the Newspapers, was to my knowledge
very incorrect.</p>

<p>I cannot close my letter without informing you that the three
following Resolutions were agreed to by the House of Commons
on the 6th instant.</p>

<p>"That it is necessary to declare, that the Influence of the
Crown has increased, is increasing, and ought to be diminished."</p>

<p>"That it is competent to this House, to examine into and
correct Abuses in the Expenditure of the Civil List Revenues,
as well as in every other branch of the Public Revenue, whenever
it shall appear expedient to the Wisdom of this House so
to do."</p>

<p>"That it is the Duty of this House, to provide, as far as may
be an immediate and effectual redress of the Abuses complained
of in the Petitions, presented to this House from the different
Counties, Cities and Towns of this Kingdom."</p>



<div class="tdr">

  <td>233</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td class="tdl">Against them</td>
  <td>215</td>
</tr>
</table></div>


<p>so that in one of the fullest houses that we have ever known a
complete approbation has been given to the sentiments of the
Petitions, with a promise to attend to their Prayers. How that
promise will be performed, it is our duty to watch; If we persevere
in our exertions, I think there is little or no doubt of obtaining
our objects, but if we are lulled into Security by Success, it is but
too probable that the Representatives of the People may relapse
into their former inattention to their constituents.</p>

<h2><a name="APPENDIX_B" id="APPENDIX_B">APPENDIX B.</a></h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">Knights and Burgesses of the City of London.</span></h3>


<p>The list of members representing the City of London in
Parliament from 1284 down to the present day, here given, has
been compiled mainly from the Blue Books of Parliamentary
returns (printed in 1878 and 1879), but with large additions
gathered from the City's own Records. It may fairly claim to be
a more perfect list of City members than has hitherto been
published.</p>

<p>The number of representatives of the City in Parliament has
varied from time to time. In a treatise known as <i>Modus tenendi
Parliamentum</i>, ascribed to the early part of the xiv<sup>th</sup> century, the
number of members for London, York and other Cities is given
as two, the same as the number of Barons of the Cinq Ports
and knights of shires.<a name="FNanchor_854" id="FNanchor_854"></a><a href="#Footnote_854" class="fnanchor">[854]</a> The more usual number as gathered
from the City's Archives was either two or four, although there
have been occasions (as in the Parliament of 1284 and more
especially during the Commonwealth) when it amounted to six
and (as in Barebone's Parliament) even to seven. Frequently
it happened that when the writ prescribed the election of two
members, four or more were elected, although not more than
two or, perhaps, three, were to attend.<a name="FNanchor_855" id="FNanchor_855"></a><a href="#Footnote_855" class="fnanchor">[855]</a> It is in 1346 that we
meet for the first time with a writ commanding the election of four
members. In the following year a writ was issued for the election
of the old number (two), but this was apparently a mistake,
for another writ was soon afterwards issued stating that the
number should be four. The City, however, displayed great
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_468" id="Page_468">[Pg 468]</a></span>apathy in the matter&mdash;the attendance in Parliament interfered
no doubt with the commercial pursuits of the members&mdash;and,
although four were elected, it was distinctly provided that any
three or even two might attend.<a name="FNanchor_856" id="FNanchor_856"></a><a href="#Footnote_856" class="fnanchor">[856]</a> On the other hand, when
the City was called upon to elect two members for the Parliament
of 1348, it returned four.<a name="FNanchor_857" id="FNanchor_857"></a><a href="#Footnote_857" class="fnanchor">[857]</a> From 1351 to 1354 the
writs prescribed only two members, and the City returned only
two, but from 1355 down to the passing of the Redistribution
of Seats Act in 1885<a name="FNanchor_858" id="FNanchor_858"></a><a href="#Footnote_858" class="fnanchor">[858]</a>&mdash;that is to say, for a period of more than
500 years&mdash;the City of London has, if we except the Parliament
of 1371, never been represented in the council of the nation by
less than four members.</p>

<p>So long as the City was represented by two members, both
were usually aldermen.<a name="FNanchor_859" id="FNanchor_859"></a><a href="#Footnote_859" class="fnanchor">[859]</a> When four were returned, two were, as
a rule, aldermen, and two commoners. The Recorder, who in
earliest times was also an alderman of the City, was frequently
returned with another alderman, and continued to be so returned
long after he had ceased to be elected from the body of aldermen.
Indeed, for two centuries&mdash;viz., from 1454 to 1654&mdash;the Recorder
for the time being seldom failed to be elected one of the City's
members; but from the time of the Restoration no Recorder has
sat for the City, nor has the ancient custom of the City to be
represented by an equal number of aldermen and commoners
been followed. Prior to the Restoration the custom was so
strictly observed that when a member who was a commoner
happened to be elected alderman, he resigned his seat in Parliament
in order that another commoner might be elected.<a name="FNanchor_860" id="FNanchor_860"></a><a href="#Footnote_860" class="fnanchor">[860]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_469" id="Page_469">[Pg 469]</a></span></p>

<p>The parliamentary elections were originally carried out by the
mayor and aldermen and a deputation specially summoned from
each ward, but the choice of members practically lay with the
mayor and aldermen. In course of time the commoners came
to be elected by the Common Council, but the aldermen still kept
a hold on the elections by nominating certain individuals of whom
the citizens were to make their choice.<a name="FNanchor_861" id="FNanchor_861"></a><a href="#Footnote_861" class="fnanchor">[861]</a></p>

<p>In 1523 we find an election taking place at the [court of]
Husting<a name="FNanchor_862" id="FNanchor_862"></a><a href="#Footnote_862" class="fnanchor">[862]</a> in the Great Hall. One alderman and the Recorder were
nominated by the Court of Aldermen and their nomination was
subsequently confirmed by the Common Council in the Guildhall;
whilst two commoners were nominated by the commonalty attending
at the Husting. But even the latter nominations appear to have
been in this instance confirmed by the Common Council.<a name="FNanchor_863" id="FNanchor_863"></a><a href="#Footnote_863" class="fnanchor">[863]</a> Six years
later (viz., in 1529) the election proceedings are recorded somewhat
differently. The election took place as before at the [court of]
Husting in the Great Hall, the aldermen were nominated by the
mayor and aldermen in the Inner Chamber of the Guildhall [<i>i.e.</i>, in
the Court of Aldermen] and were afterwards ratified and confirmed
by a large gathering of the commonalty (<i>immensa communitas</i>) in
the Great Hall, but the commoners were elected by the commonalty
without any subsequent ratification by the Common Council.<a name="FNanchor_864" id="FNanchor_864"></a><a href="#Footnote_864" class="fnanchor">[864]</a></p>

<p>At what date the Livery&mdash;as distinct from the citizens at
large&mdash;began to usurp the functions of the commonalty and claim
the exclusive right of electing City members, is not clear; but
that they did so monopolise the Parliamentary franchise long before
it was restricted to them by the Election Act of 1725, there is
ample evidence,<a name="FNanchor_865" id="FNanchor_865"></a><a href="#Footnote_865" class="fnanchor">[865]</a> and they continued to enjoy this monopoly until
the passing of the Reform Act of 1832.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_470" id="Page_470">[Pg 470]</a></span></p>

<p>The City members enjoyed, as we have seen,<a name="FNanchor_866" id="FNanchor_866"></a><a href="#Footnote_866" class="fnanchor">[866]</a> certain allowances
by way of "duties," "fees" or "wages," for their attendance
in Parliament, besides gowns, robes or liveries for themselves and
their servants, and a reasonable sum of money for expenses.
According to Coke (4 Inst., p. 46) the fee or wage paid "time out
of mind" to a knight of the shire was four shillings a day, whilst
that to a citizen or burgess was half that sum;<a name="FNanchor_867" id="FNanchor_867"></a><a href="#Footnote_867" class="fnanchor">[867]</a> and these same
fees the City Chamberlain paid in 1584 to the alderman and the
Recorder representing the City in Parliament, presumably, in their
capacity as knights of the shire (the City of London itself constituting
a county), and to the two commoners, sitting as burgesses,
respectively.<a name="FNanchor_868" id="FNanchor_868"></a><a href="#Footnote_868" class="fnanchor">[868]</a> In 1628 a question was raised in the House as to
whether the aldermen representing the City in Parliment ranked
as knights, but no decision appears to have been arrived at.<a name="FNanchor_869" id="FNanchor_869"></a><a href="#Footnote_869" class="fnanchor">[869]</a></p>

<p>When the City members attended Parliament, they went as
befitted the representatives of the capital of the kingdom. Alderman
and commoner alike wore scarlet gowns richly trimmed with
fur, for which they received allowances, according to their dignity,
of cloth and money. An alderman was allowed ten yards of cloth
for his gown, a commoner five. Again, an alderman who had
served as mayor received an allowance of 100 shillings for fur; an
alderman who had not passed the chair was entitled to no more
than 5 marks, whilst commoners received only half that sum.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_471" id="Page_471">[Pg 471]</a></span></p>

<p>One "livery" a session was the usual allowance, provided that
there was not more than one session within the year; but when,
as in 1532, Parliament continued to sit for a number of years, an
allowance in cash was made to the members in lieu of another
livery for themselves and their servants. This cash payment
amounted to &pound;6 13<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i><a name="FNanchor_870" id="FNanchor_870"></a><a href="#Footnote_870" class="fnanchor">[870]</a></p>

<p>In addition to wages and allowances already mentioned, the
City members were allowed a certain amount of travelling
(and other) expenses. From the ancient treatise already referred
to we gather that in this respect (if in no other) they were
customarily placed on an equality with the knights of shires.<a name="FNanchor_871" id="FNanchor_871"></a><a href="#Footnote_871" class="fnanchor">[871]</a>
When Parliament sat at Westminster, these travelling expenses
amounted to little more than a shilling a day&mdash;the sum allowed
them for boat-hire;<a name="FNanchor_872" id="FNanchor_872"></a><a href="#Footnote_872" class="fnanchor">[872]</a> when, on the other hand, Parliament sat in
some remote town, as it frequently did, they were greater. Thus
in 1296, when Parliament was to meet at Bury St. Edmunds, the
citizens voted their representatives 20 shillings a day for travelling
expenses.<a name="FNanchor_873" id="FNanchor_873"></a><a href="#Footnote_873" class="fnanchor">[873]</a> The two aldermen who represented the City in the
Parliament held at York in 1298 were each allowed 100 shillings
and no more.<a name="FNanchor_874" id="FNanchor_874"></a><a href="#Footnote_874" class="fnanchor">[874]</a> On the other hand when nearly a century later
(1388), Parliament sat at Cambridge, the City members were not
only allowed their travelling expenses, but the cost of their board
and lodging, and even their washing bills were discharged by the
Corporation, the whole amounting to upwards of &pound;100, a large
sum in those days.<a name="FNanchor_875" id="FNanchor_875"></a><a href="#Footnote_875" class="fnanchor">[875]</a></p>

<p>In the middle of the 15th century, viz., in Thomas Chalton's
mayoralty (1449-1450), the Common Council resolved that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_472" id="Page_472">[Pg 472]</a></span>thenceforth the allowance for expenses should not exceed 40
shillings a day, but ten years later, when Parliament was to meet
at Coventry, it showed a more liberal spirit and undertook to
repay any further disbursements that the members might make
for the honour and benefit of the City.<a name="FNanchor_876" id="FNanchor_876"></a><a href="#Footnote_876" class="fnanchor">[876]</a> It did the same in
1464, when Parliament was to have sat at York.<a name="FNanchor_877" id="FNanchor_877"></a><a href="#Footnote_877" class="fnanchor">[877]</a></p>

<p>How long the City continued to make payments and allowances
to its members is not clear. No doubt, as wealth increased
and a seat in the House was looked upon less as a burden,
men were found ready to undertake the duties on their own
responsibility and without any extraneous assistance, and the
custom of payment of members by the City became gradually
obsolete. Take, for instance, the case of two of the City's
representatives in the Parliament of 1661. Whilst, on the one
hand, we find the Court of Aldermen authorising the Chamberlain
to pay to John Jones, a burgess, a daily allowance of four
shillings&mdash;a sum usually allowed knights of the shire&mdash;and this
amount is recorded in the City's Chamber Accounts as having
been duly paid;<a name="FNanchor_878" id="FNanchor_878"></a><a href="#Footnote_878" class="fnanchor">[878]</a> on the other hand, we find alderman Sir John
Frederick (elected member for the City <i>loco</i> alderman Fowke
deceased) returning the fees and allowances paid to him by the
Chamberlain "for his full allowance for diett and boate hire ...
and for his Robes alsoe."<a name="FNanchor_879" id="FNanchor_879"></a><a href="#Footnote_879" class="fnanchor">[879]</a></p>

<p>Lastly, it is to be noted that on the occasion of the opening
of a new Parliament, the members for the City claim, and
generally exercise, the privilege of sitting on the Treasury or
Privy Councillor's bench; but on what grounds such privilege is
claimed and allowed is not clear.<a name="FNanchor_880" id="FNanchor_880"></a><a href="#Footnote_880" class="fnanchor">[880]</a></p>

shire were in the habit of receiving sums varying from 1<i>&#771;s.</i> to 6<i>&#771;s.</i> 8<i>d.</i> a day.
From the year 1327 their allowance was 4<i>&#771;s.</i> a day exclusive of travelling
expenses, and this sum appears to have been paid as long as members received
payment for attendance in Parliament.&mdash;See Preface to <i>Modus tenendi Parliamentum</i>,

same fees had been authorised by the Court of Aldermen three years before.&mdash;Repertory
20, fo. 183. After the Restoration, when more than two aldermen
were frequently returned, the junior members (whether aldermen or commoners)
received the burgess fee of two shillings a day, as witness the case of
Sir John Robinson&mdash;the only City member sitting in the first Parliament after
the Restoration whose name has come down to us.&mdash;See Chamber Accounts,
Vol. 1/11, fo. 145. The expense was defrayed, in early days, by the exaction
of one penny in the pound from every individual who had been assessed for
the last fifteenth.&mdash;Letter Book E, fos. 20, 22.</p></div>
